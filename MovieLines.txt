 I'll be eternally tweaking it, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line.
 You won't hurt my feelings.
 Honest.
 Swing on back to Drew's Script-O-Rama afterwards for more free scripts!
 Harold and Kumar Billy Boy!
 Get your ass ready.
 It's almost 5:00, and this bad boy needs to get his drink on.
 No, no, no.
 Give me that.
 Don't.
 I'm gonna burn it once and for all.
 Stop that.
 Dude, it's been six months.
 It's time to move on, okay?
 Whatever.
 Even if I wanted to meet other women, I wouldn't even know what to do.
 I've been out of the game for so long.
 Dude, you come out with me tonight, I promise you will get laid.
 Yeah, it sounds very tempting, but Berenson needs me to update these financial models for the meeting with the foreign investors.
 So what?
 It's Friday night.
 The Germans are taking an early flight back.
 The meeting got changed to tomorrow.
 So?
 Why don't you just get somebody else to do your work for you?
 Who?
 Harold, I need you to update those models for me.
 Billy, aren't you supposed to...
 I know.
 Something just came up.
 I have this meeting with these new clients tonight, and I'm never gonna have time to get to those.
 So that's your responsibility now, big boy.
 Make sure those are in by 9:00 sharp tomorrow.
 With all the downsizing that's been going on around here, we wouldn't want to have to tell Berenson you've been slacking, now would we?
 Yeah.
 Okay, no problem.
 Hey.
 You have a great weekend, okay, buddy?
 I owe you one.
 Just one.
 Thank you.
 Wow!
 That was amazing.
 I cannot believe how easy that was.
 Dude, how do you think I get all my shit done?
 I'm telling you, those Asian guys love crunching numbers.
 You probably just made his weekend.
 Chick magnet Chick magnet.
 Chick magnet Chick magnet.
 Yeah Fuck.
 An excellent point, Mr Patel.
 You are one of the finest applicants I have ever interviewed.
 Thank you.
 It comes as no surprise.
 Your father is highly respected in his field.
 As you probably heard from your old man, he and I had some pretty wild times back in med school.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 We started our own basketball team...
 the Hemoglobin Trotters.
 Hemo-globin Trotters...
 get it?
 A play on the name of the famous colored, Negro basketball squad...
 black, African-American.
 You know, people of colors.
 Let's end up with one final question, just as a formality.
 What are some potential symptoms of pancreatitis?
 Well, you would have epigastric tenderness, diffuse abdominal tenderness...
 I'm sorry.
 Can you hold on one second?
 Kumar's phone.
 Kumar speaking.
 Hey, what's up?
 It's me.
 What are you doing?
 Nothing important.
 I can talk.
 What's going on?
 Listen, I can't party tonight, okay?
 I gotta stay late at the office.
 Dude, fuck that shit.
 We had plans.
 I know, but I got a lot of work to do.
 When has getting high ever prevented you from doing your work?
 Jesus!
 Believe me.
 I would love to come home.
 Okay?
 I got a lot of work to do.
 Thank you.
 I'll do that.
 I got a quarter of the finest herb in New York City.
 I'm not smoking that shit alone, okay?
 So you need to just chill the fuck out and prepare to get blazed because in the next couple of hours, I expect both of us to be blitzed out of our skulls, got it?
 All right, I got it.
 I'll talk to you later.
 Where was I?
 We've got the severe anal discharge, sometimes violent...
 a.k.a.
 Diarrhea.
 Mr Patel, I am more than familiar with diarrhea.
 Do you actually believe after the way you've just behaved that I would ever even consider recommending you for admission?
 No.
 I'm gonna be honest with you.
 The only reason I'm applying is so my dad will keep paying for my apartment.
 I really don't have a desire to go to med school.
 But you have perfect MCAT scores.
 Yeah.
 Just 'cause you're hung like a moose doesn't mean you gotta do porn.
 Get out!
 Bernadette, show this young man to the door!
 And please bring in some fresh diarrhe...
 dry towels!
 Yes!
 Right in front of the door.
 This is America, dude!
 Learn how to drive!
 Better "ruck" tomorrow!
 Extreme!
 Fucking assholes.
 Fuck.
 Okay.
 Be yourself.
 Don't be nervous.
 So, Maria, what's been goin' on?
 I actually had a very long week at work.
 How about you?
 Work was good.
 I caught up on some sleep.
 Plus, the guy who works next to me decided to bathe for a change.
 Really?
 So what are you up to tonight?
 Actually, I'm just gonna be sitting on my ass, probably eat a whole pint of Haagen-Dazs while I watch Blind Date.
 Well, that sounds awful.
 If you want some company, maybe you can come over and sit on your ass at my place.
 That sounds nice.
 Bye.
 Bye.
 Bye.
 Kumar.
 Yo.
 Yo, Kumar.
 Yo, I'm in here, dude.
 Hey!
 What the hell are you doing?
 I'm trimming my pubes.
 Why aren't you doing this in your room, man?
 The mirror's in here.
 Hey, check it out.
 It's like a bonsai tree.
 Hey!
 Besides, man, it makes your johnson look totally bigger.
 Please!
 Are those my scissors?
 Dude, I trim my nose hair with those!
 Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months.
 Get out!
 Get out of my room.
 Kumar.
 It's Daddy.
 I hope your interview today was good.
 I'm calling to remind you that you have another one tomorrow with Dr Wein from Cornell at 10 a.m.
 Do not be late.
 Hook it up, bi-yatch.
 Let's do it.
 Fuck!
 In tonight's top story.
 A cheetah escaped earlier today from the Morristown Zoo.
 Oh, nice.
 Sixteen Candles is on, man.
 And the award for the least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to...
 Harold Lee.
 Come on down, man.
 Take a bow.
 Shut up, man.
 It's a classic.
 It's a very beautiful story about someone who feels unnoticed, unappreciated, unloved, you know?
 Turn it.
 It's a good one, though.
 Homo.
 Come on.
 Dude.
 Just take one hit.
 Don't you wanna be cool?
 Hey.
 Man.
 What are you doin'?
 I'm so high!
 Nothing can hurt me.
 No!
 Marijuana kills.
 I love that shit.
 We're so high right now.
 We're not low.
 Dude, I don't know about you, but I'm fuckin' hungry as balls.
 No shit, dude.
 Let's eat.
 No, I don't feel like delivery tonight.
 What about KFC?
 We've been there too many times.
 I want something we haven't had in a while.
 Something different, something that'll really hit the spot.
 I want the perfect food.
 Are you hungry?
 Then come to White Castle and try our Slyder Special...
 Six burgers.
 Fries.
 And a soft drink for only $2.99.
 Imagine all those burgers in your stomach right now.
 Don't you like food that's tasty and delicious?
 I do.
 Then what are you waiting for?
 Head over to White Castle.
 It's what you crave.
 You sure you know how to get there?
 I haven't been to White Castle in ages.
 Dude, I'm telling you, there's one right by that multiplex in New Brunswick.
 Nice.
 Rosenberg!
 Goldstein!
 Yo, Manny and Shevitz, get up.
 We're going to White Castle.
 No, we're watching The Gift on HBO.
 No, no, no.
 No watching.
 We're starving.
 Hey, put that back.
 No eating until we get to White Castle.
 Let's roll.
 Sorry, kids, we ain't going nowhere.
 Supposedly Katie Holmes shows her titties in this movie.
 Is that all you Jews ever think about...
 tits?
 Katie Holmes is a nice, respectable, wholesome girl.
 And I'm gonna see her boobs.
 The things I would eat out of her ass...
 you have no idea!
 That is a completely vulgar statement.
 So is "I want to bang Britney Spears on the bathroom floor." But it's true.
 Touche.
 Hey, listen, if...
 I think Kumar's a faygele.
 They're totally gay for each other.
 Hey, you wanna suck on this?
 Uh-huh.
 What the hell are you bringing your bag for?
 Try to get some work done in the car.
 Here, you're driving.
 Shit, I forgot my cell phone.
 You wanna run back and get it?
 No, we've gone too far.
 Hey, there's your girlfriend.
 You gonna talk to her this time, or are you gonna be a Vagina McGinastein about it?
 What the hell are you doing?
 You could've asked her if she wanted to come to White Castle with us.
 Hold the elevator.
 Wait!
 Hey, how are...
 You're worthless.
 I'm not worthwhile.
 Just fucking talk to her once.
 It won't be weird anymore.
 Look, it doesn't matter.
 The only girls who are interested in me are girls I have no interest in.
 Like Cindy Kim.
 Speaking of Cindy, she called earlier.
 One of those Asian clubs she's in is throwing a party at her dorm tonight.
 God, she invites me to everything.
 So what?
 She's kind of fuckin' cute.
 Let her touch your penis.
 Oh, look.
 It's the Brothers McFag.
 Let me guess...
 the one with the purse is the catcher.
 Come on, guys, let's get ourselves some fucking Mountain Dew.
 Extreme!
 Yeah, extreme assholes.
 Why do I have to be the catcher?
 Dude, forget about those pricks.
 Let's just get some food.
 I am so hungry.
 I'm gonna eat, like, 20 of those burgers, man.
 Dude, fuckin' I will see your 20 burgers and raise you 5 orders of fries.
 Dude, give me 35 cents.
 What's going on?
 It didn't register.
 What?
 Give me 35 more cents.
 I don't have any more change.
 Should I just go through?
 No, no, I don't like breaking the law.
 Yeah, I can see that.
 Hey, move your ass!
 I'm sorry.
 Hold on.
 I'm going through.
 No, don't.
 No.
 No.
 Hold on.
 Let me walk to a manned tollbooth and I'll tell them what happened.
 Sorry!
 Move, you fuckin' twat!
 What's the fuckin' holdup here?
 Shit.
 Move, you retarded cocksucker!
 Move!
 Are you crazy?
 What?
 What are you doing?
 Why you throwing the weed out?!
 The cops are gonna catch us.
 No, they're not.
 Not for that.
 Take this exit.
 What?
 Take this exit!
 No!
 Dude!
 You know, that was the last of our weed.
 Sorry.
 I get a little paranoid sometimes.
 Now we're in Newark, of all places.
 You know we're gonna get shot.
 Maybe it's not as bad as they say.
 Maybe it's just a bunch of hype.
 Check it out.
 Those guys look like a lame version of us.
 Holy shit!
 Holy shit!
 Let's get the fuck outta here.
 Go!
 Go!
 Drive!
 Drive!
 Yeah, that was your fault.
 Fuck you.
 Fuck you.
 Yo, check it out.
 We're almost there.
 Thank God.
 I'm starving.
 Hello, New Brunswick!
 Prepare to gorge yourself.
 You know...
 We need some tunage for this.
 Presets.
 Use the presets.
 Oh, come on, dude, your whole life is preset.
 Try something new.
 Where is this place?
 Isn't it supposed to be right around here?
 Chill.
 We'll find it.
 Wait a second...
 is that the multiplex?
 Yes.
 Sweet!
 That means the White Castle should be right around the corner.
 What the hell is going on, Kumar?
 That does not look like a White Castle to me.
 Uh-uh.
 Dude, we gotta check this out.
 Hey, look here, fellas.
 You guys gonna have to order from the drive-thru menu.
 What happened to the White Castle?
 What?
 There used to be a White Castle right here in this location.
 Where is it?
 I hate to be the bearer of bad news, guys, but Burger Shack, they bought this location about four years ago.
 God!
 Please tell me there's another White Castle in town.
 No.
 Are you sure?
 Do I look like the kind of brother that would be unsure about something like that?
 Shit!
 What are we gonna do?
 I don't know, man.
 Should we just eat here?
 Hey.
 Psst.
 There's a White Castle that's open 24 hours up in Cherry Hill.
 It's about 45 minutes from here.
 I can make the trip if you're willing to.
 Kumar, I got a shitload of work to finish.
 You got that med school interview.
 Forget about the med school interview.
 It's a non-issue.
 What do you mean it's a non-issue?
 Ding-dong!
 May I interject for a second?
 As a Burger Shack employee for the past three years, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that if you're craving White Castle, the burgers here just don't cut it.
 In fact, just thinking about those tender little White Castle burgers with those little, itty-bitty grilled onions that just explode in your mouth like flavor crystals every time you bite into one...
 ...just makes me want to burn this motherfucker down.
 Come on, Pookie, let's burn this motherfucker down!
 Come on, Pookie!
 Let's burn it, Pookie!
 Let's burn this motherfucker down!
 Let's burn it down!
 Let's burn it!
 So you guys maybe should just suck it up and go to White Castle.
 You can always get your work done in the car.
 Let's do it.
 All right.
 Awesome.
 Then listen, listen...
 no matter what, we are not ending this night without White Castle in our stomachs.
 Agreed?
 Agreed.
 Wise choice.
 You guys might have wanted to stay away from our special sauce tonight.
 Me and Pookie, we added a secret ingredient.
 I'll give you a hint.
 It's semen.
 Semen.
 Animal semen.
 Dude, remember when Goldstein used to work at that burger place?
 This is the most fucking confusing movie I've ever seen...
 she's possessed, she's not possessed.
 Dude, that rack better be stacked.
 Tits!
 Tits!
 Boobies, boobies, boobies.
 Holy shit!
 Whoa!
 Those aren't real.
 Yes, they are.
 You know, I'm almost completely sober right now.
 I wish we had some more weed.
 Sorry.
 Princeton.
 We're getting off here.
 Why?
 Because we're gonna sweet-talk Cindy Kim into finding us some weed.
 No.
 Why not?
 You talk to her on the phone all the time.
 She calls me.
 Then she rambles on about her East Asian Students Club or whatever.
 Then I have to actually pretend that I give a shit or else she calls me a Twinkie.
 A what?
 Twinkie...
 yellow on the outside, white on the inside.
 Look, you Twinkie bitch, you were the one that threw our weed out the window, okay?
 So we're going to Princeton, and it's your responsibility to make sure we're high as shit by the time we're eating those burgers.
 Forget it.
 End of discussion.
 I am not seeing Cindy Kim.
 Harold, I'm so glad you showed up.
 Yeah, me too.
 Did you like the hibiscus petals I glued to the envelope I sent you?
 Yeah, they were nice.
 Hey, dude, you know where I can get some green?
 Dude, you know where I can get some chronic?
 Jesus, what the hell kind of lvy League school is this?
 Man.
 Over here, man.
 You lookin' to toke up?
 Yes.
 Yes?
 Thank Christ.
 Just give me a dime of your finest sticky.
 You wanna see sticky-icky, my friend?
 Oh, my God!
 Whoa, man!
 Don't touch, man.
 That's not cool.
 You can't...
 Jeez!
 This is my baby!
 Yes?
 Kenneth Park, class of 2004.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 Is it true you're an analyst for Brewster Keegan?
 Yes, I'm a junior analyst.
 Awesome!
 I told you, he's good.
 Yes.
 This is actually a two-part question.
 I'm applying for a summer internship at Brewster Keegan.
 I was wondering, a) what's it like being an investment banker, and b) would you write me a recommendation?
 Here.
 That's sixt...
 80 bucks.
 80 bucks?
 Yeah, 80 bucks.
 Yo, this is worth 40 tops, bro.
 "Bro"?
 I'm not your bro, bro.
 Okay, and that's 80 bucks.
 You don't feel like getting high tonight?
 If you don't feel like getting high, that's cool with me, because there's lots of people around here.
 See this guy?
 Hey, loser.
 Hey, what's up, George?
 I smoke buds with George all the time.
 What kind of hippie are you?
 What kind of hippie am I?
 Man, I'm a business hippie.
 I understand the concept of supply and demand.
 "What's it like being an investment banker?" To be honest with you, it's actually pretty aw...
 ...awesome.
 Excellent!
 As for the recommendation, I guess I can make a couple calls.
 Actually, Harold, we should be getting to the party.
 We can discuss all this stuff on the way there.
 It's just down the hall.
 Okay.
 I'm sorry.
 I can't go.
 I have to wait for Kumar.
 You'll see him when we're done.
 Trust me, you're gonna love this.
 Kenny's mom dropped off a big pot of kimchi jigae.
 It's really good.
 It's delicious.
 Yeah?
 That's nice.
 80 bucks, okay?
 Okay.
 Hello.
 Are you guys about to smoke?
 Yes, we're gonna smoke.
 Do you wanna come back to my place?
 Please, like they want to go listen to a bunch of Phish records while you read your lame-ass poetry.
 Girls, you guys wanna hang out, maybe smoke a little weed and have some fun?
 All right.
 All right.
 My poetry's not lame.
 It's really good.
 Yeah, I'm sure.
 It's great.
 We're gonna eat before this gets cold.
 What you say we meet back in our room in about 20 minutes?
 We're in room 109.
 109.
 Got it.
 I'll see you ladies later, huh?
 Yes!
 109.
 We'll see you ladies later.
 Yes!
 We're getting laid, bro.
 All right, I'll see you there, man.
 20...
 20...
 208?
 208.
 Yes!
 208!
 Roldy, dude, you gotta come quick.
 There's these two filthy pussies just aching to get boned by us.
 I mean, there are these two very lovely young pussies who would like to have a chat with you and I.
 Sorry.
 Harold's coming with us.
 That's bullshit.
 He's coming with me.
 Isn't that right, Roldy?
 Let's go to the party.
 No, no, no.
 Fuck that.
 Here.
 This is Harold's understudy.
 You can do whatever you want.
 Roldy, let's go.
 Sorry.
 I can't believe you were gonna ditch me for the Joy Luck Club.
 You know what their parties are like.
 What do you want me to say?
 I was under pressure.
 Just say no.
 That's all it takes.
 Here.
 All right, take a hit of that.
 What's going on up there?
 Barracuda to Sparrow, Barracuda to Sparrow.
 We got two high-fliers on level three.
 I just wanna talk!
 Dude, in here, in here.
 Women!
 What if someone finds us in here?
 Chill the fuck out.
 He's not gonna look for us in the girls' bathroom.
 Shit!
 Come here.
 It worked on me.
 There's no reason it shouldn't work on you.
 But your breasts look beautiful.
 I just want those cute little ping-pong breasts.
 You know, that kind of go...
 Hurry up because I want to go smoke weed with that dishy Indian guy.
 It's gonna be a few minutes.
 I'm about to have the worst case of taco shits.
 Oh, God.
 Great, I think I've got to go, too.
 Hey, Clarissa, do you want to play battle shits?
 Oh, my God!
 Battle shits?
 We haven't played that since back at camp.
 I know, I know.
 Wait for it.
 Hit.
 Scag!
 You sank my destroyer!
 Fuck!
 I can't take it anymore!
 Christy, are you still there?
 Damn!
 You sank my battle shit!
 Shit.
 Dude!
 She said in 20-10?
 Have you seen a Korean guy around here?
 Yeah, only when I open my eyes, though.
 'Tard.
 20-11.
 Yo, this party's bumpin'!
 Who wants some Buda?
 Yeah!
 Holy shit!
 Kenneth Park, class of 2004.
 Dude, I'm thinking you really screwed up by not coming to this party.
 I screwed up?
 Can we have some pot brownies?
 I don't know.
 I'm running a little low.
 A titty flash might persuade me.
 Should we?
 I think you should.
 Okay.
 Whoa.
 Whoa.
 Hey, you!
 Shit!
 Hey!
 Hey!
 Let's get 'em!
 Halt!
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Harold!
 Harold!
 No, no, no.
 Hey, dude!
 Come here!
 Well, well, well.
 What do we have here?
 Oh, no!
 That's my baby!
 Hold his throat and groin.
 Come on, rookie.
 Should we go back for the weed?
 Are you crazy?
 Run!
 Run!
 I can't believe it, man.
 We were this close to getting laid.
 Oh, dude, you always exaggerate.
 The diarrhea twins definitely would have had sex with us.
 What about Cindy?
 She was looking kinda cute tonight, man.
 Cindy's fine.
 It's just...
 Just what?
 We...
 Oh, you'd rather have Maria.
 Look, it doesn't matter.
 I'm gonna end up with Cindy Kim whether I like it or not.
 Can we just drop this and get our asses to White Castle, man?
 Fine.
 Maria.
 What are you doing?
 Daddy needs to urinate.
 Hurry up!
 I'm serious.
 Don't take all night.
 All right.
 Excuse me, I have to...
 Huh?
 I have to ask you.
 Why are you peeing right here?
 What?
 I mean, why'd you pee right next to me when you could choose that bush or...
 This is a good bush to pee on.
 Why are you peeing on it?
 Well, no one was here when I chose this bush.
 Oh.
 So you get to pee on it and no one else does?
 Huh?
 No, I just...
 This your bush?
 You have a special bond with this bush?
 No, I just thought that...
 You the king of the forest?
 I'm sorry?
 What?
 Are you a fuckin' tree-hugger?
 Is this your special bush?!
 Never mind.
 Forget it.
 I really don't feel like getting stabbed tonight.
 Nice pubes.
 Thanks.
 Do you even know where you're going?
 I'm gonna be honest, I'm a little lost, but, you know, once we get back on the highway, we'll be there soon, don't worry.
 We'd better.
 Shit.
 Now it's raining.
 Put on your wipers.
 What are you talking about?
 It's just a little mist.
 Yeah, mist, hence the mist setting.
 It's a safety issue, okay?
 There we go.
 Thank you, Mr Wizard.
 What crawled up your ass?
 I'm completely on edge right now, man.
 After all the shit that we've been through tonight, I don't know how much more I can take.
 Oh, shit!
 How the fuck did that get in here?
 Oh, shit!
 He bit me!
 I've got rabies!
 Oh, my God!
 Dude, get that fuckin' cancer raccoon away from me!
 Open my window!
 Fuck you, raccoon!
 What the Christ?
 Shit!
 Shit!
 Jesus!
 You all right?
 I don't know.
 Shit.
 Shit, dude, he's coming over here.
 Probably some old blind bitch!
 What the fuck are you doing?
 We're sorry.
 We're very sorry!
 Holy shit!
 Goldstein?
 Dude, it's Rold and Kumar.
 Shit.
 What's going on, man?
 What's up, dude?
 What's up?
 All right.
 What the hell are you guys doing here?
 We got the munchies, so we decided we'd go to Hot Dog Heaven.
 How about you?
 How was White Castle?
 We haven't gotten there yet.
 I think I may have rabies.
 Yo, dude, how were Katie Holmes' tits?
 You know the Holocaust?
 Yeah.
 Picture the exact opposite of that.
 Nice.
 Boy, do you need a girl.
 If you guys got the yellow fever, there's a rockin' Asian party down at Princeton.
 Dude, I got the yellow plague.
 There's nothing sexier than a hot Asian chick!
 Asian tits...
 I wanna squeeze 'em!
 Stop.
 Don't do that.
 Please, do not touch me.
 I'm very woozy.
 I think I have to go to the hospital.
 You should go to Beth Israel.
 We gotta hit up this Asian joint.
 No, we don't.
 We got to go to Hot Dog Heaven.
 No more detours along the way.
 This is what I'm dealing with.
 Come on!
 I'm telling you, hit up the Asian party.
 Did you leave the key in the car with the engine running?
 Good luck.
 You don't have rabies.
 We're not going to a hospital.
 You're fine.
 Uh...
 Yeah, I don't have rabies.
 Great.
 Let's just get out of here.
 Hey, aren't those the guys that got the shit kicked...
 I know.
 I know.
 Let's just go.
 Just go.
 Kumar.
 Hey, it's your dad and brother.
 Shit.
 No wonder you didn't want to go to the hospital.
 Hey, Dad.
 Hi, Dr Patel.
 What's up?
 Saikat.
 What's going on?
 I hope you are here to apologize for what you did in your interview today.
 What the hell's wrong with you, Kumar?
 God!
 You're 22 years old.
 When are you gonna grow up and stop this post-college rebel bullshit?
 Like your life is so hard.
 Eat my balls, Saikat.
 I will not tolerate this business from you any longer.
 You have one more interview tomorrow morning, and if I hear from Dr Wein that you were anything short of spectacular, I'll completely cut you off.
 Dad, come on.
 Daddy is not coming on anything.
 You will be there, and you will behave.
 I have put too much time and energy into you to let you go and fuck it all up!
 You're absolutely right.
 I'm sorry, guys.
 Wow, I'm sorry.
 Sorry.
 It won't happen again, okay?
 Good.
 I will speak with you tomorrow.
 Bye, Harold.
 Bye.
 See ya.
 Wow, man.
 I guess you're going to med school after all, eh?
 Fuck that, dude.
 Like I care what my dad thinks.
 I can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out I didn't go to my interview tomorrow.
 If he wants to cut me off, fine.
 I don't need his money.
 I don't understand.
 You just hugged him.
 Yeah, I just needed to get my hands on this.
 Access card.
 Two words for you, bro...
 medical marijuana.
 No.
 Oh, this is stolen.
 If we get caught, you are taking the blame.
 This is not my idea.
 We're not gonna get caught, okay?
 We're gonna go get baked and then go eat just like we planned.
 Now, just calm down.
 We gotta find the pharmacy.
 Dr Patel!
 Thank God I found you.
 We have an emergency.
 Nurses, I need these two doctors scrubbed, gloved, and ready for the O.R.
 Stat!
 What the hell is going on?
 He probably thinks I'm my brother.
 Just don't worry about it.
 Leave the talking to me.
 It's a godforsaken bloodbath.
 The patient was brought in by EMS five minutes ago.
 As you can see, we have three horrific gunshot wounds.
 It's a good thing I found you two.
 All the other surgeons are working on other patients.
 No, there's been a mistake.
 What Dr Lee is trying to say is that we need to sedate the patient...
 ...or he could go into cardiac arrest.
 All right, I'll get the anesthesiologist.
 Hang on a second, nurse.
 What we should probably use is marijuana.
 That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.
 Marijuana?
 But why?
 We don't have time for questions.
 We need marijuana now, as much of it as possible!
 Like a big bag of it.
 But, Doctor, we don't have marijuana in this hospital.
 Shit.
 Oh, shit!
 This guy's gonna die!
 Doctor, you've got to do something or we're gonna lose him!
 I'm gonna do this the old-fashioned way.
 Start the nitrous.
 Give me two large-bore I.V.
 S and start a Ringers lactate push.
 Dr Roldy, hold this.
 More gauze, please.
 Doctor, the patient is desatting.
 Dude, he's desatting!
 He's desatting!
 The patient has a collapsed lung.
 I need a 14-gauge angiocath stat.
 That was genius.
 Thank you.
 Great job!
 You guys did it.
 No, it's you.
 Sexy.
 What'd you say?
 Nothing.
 Sweet-pea.
 The patient appears to be stabilized.
 Good work, doctors, all around.
 Great.
 One of you clean this up, please.
 Put the chest tube in.
 Meow.
 You're moist.
 I'm not sweating anymore.
 You're glistening.
 Soft and chocolate lips...
 Could I get a little dab here?
 Hush now, hush now.
 Excuse me, sir.
 Do you happen to know how to get to the White Castle in Cherry Hill from here?
 Yeah.
 Take the 33 west and take the Turnpike south, and there you are.
 I'm telling you, man, that was amazing!
 Even your dad would have been impressed, man.
 Yeah, it wasn't that bad.
 This is perfect.
 We're back on the road, we got directions, it stopped raining.
 And guess what, man.
 I'm officially done with my work.
 Oh, yeah?
 Nice!
 I'm telling you, dude, things are finally starting to go our way.
 Hey, dude, check it out...
 Sixteen Candles.
 Isn't that your favorite movie?
 Wow, man, that's awesome!
 Yo, look who decided to go see it.
 Holy shit.
 See!
 You said you two had nothing in common, but you both have the same lame taste in movies!
 Shut up.
 Hey, we should ask her if she wants to come to White Castle.
 No.
 No, no.
 Forget about it.
 Just drive.
 Dude, come on.
 It's 1:00 in the morning.
 We're an hour away from home, and who do we see but your dream girl standing across the street?
 Just pretend you're a nerdy Asian version of Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan with bigger tits.
 The cars are going.
 Can we go?
 How about that?
 What are you doing?
 Excuse me, Maria!
 What are you doing?
 Maria!
 Excuse me for a second!
 Come here!
 No!
 What the hell are you doing?
 Get your hand off the gas!
 Shit!
 I'm stuck!
 Stop turning the wheel!
 I am stuck!
 What do you mean you're stuck?
 Get unstuck!
 You asshole!
 Wha...
 wha...?
 We could have seriously injured ourselves, man!
 Yo, don't blame me, genius.
 I'm not the one who decided to run us off the frickin' road, all right?
 Let's just get back on the highway, okay?
 Fine with me.
 It's not funny.
 Where's my spare tire?
 I don't know.
 Where the hell is my spare tire?
 Oh, yeah!
 Dude, remember that time we got really stoned and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float?
 What bridge?
 I don't remem...
 What are you talking about?
 Oh, shit, that's right.
 That was with Goldstein.
 We borrowed your car that night.
 My bad.
 Your bad?
 What the hell are we gonna do now?
 Hey!
 Hey!
 Excuse me!
 Hello!
 Over here!
 Excuse me!
 You boys need some help?
 Thanks for helping us out.
 No problem at all.
 I seen you two stranded out there alone in the dark, and I said to myself...
 "What would Jesus do?" Goin' down to Georgia Gonna get myself baptized, gonna get myself baptized In the bosom of the Lord Have you boys accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior?
 Yes.
 Yeah, he's great.
 Cool guy.
 Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition!
 Name's Randy, but everybody calls me Freakshow.
 My name's Kumar.
 How are you, Kunie?
 This is Harold.
 Hi, Jerald.
 How are you?
 So where exactly are we going?
 Don't you worry about that none.
 We ain't too far from my place.
 Once we get there, I'll have your ride fixed up in a jiffy.
 Check out those boils on his neck.
 You gotta look.
 One of them's actually pulsating.
 Shut up.
 He's right next to me.
 He can hear you.
 Now there's some sort of puss.
 It's disgusting!
 Shut up.
 Just one little boil.
 Just look at it.
 See, isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever seen?
 Do you think just because you're whispering, he can't hear what you're saying?
 He's two feet away from us.
 He can hear this entire conversation.
 He can hear me talking right now.
 Don't worry about it.
 He can't hear anything...
 not with all that crust in his ear.
 I heard everything you said.
 It's gonna take me a while to fix up your car there, so if you boys like, you can go on inside, get yourselves something to drink, wash up, fuck my wife, watch TV...
 anything you want.
 Mi casa es su casa.
 Just don't do anything the Good Lord wouldn't do.
 Thank you.
 We're gonna die.
 He's going to kill us.
 We're gonna die.
 Dude, am I deaf, or did he just say we get to fuck his wife?
 He couldn't have said that.
 Who cares?
 You've seen Freakshow.
 What do you think his wife is gonna look like?
 Oh, hi, boys.
 I'm Freakshow's wife Liane.
 Can I get you some pink lemonade?
 Why don't you just go have a seat in the living room?
 I'll be back in a jiffy.
 Thanks.
 Hot.
 Hot!
 Uh-huh.
 Jesus Christ.
 Okay, it's official.
 We've entered the Twilight Zone.
 Dude, Liane is fucking hot.
 She's not ugly.
 Here you go, boys.
 Thank you.
 Thanks a lot.
 Liane, how are things between you and Freakshow presently?
 Oh!
 They've never been better.
 We love each other so much.
 I was just wondering, how does a guy like Freakshow...
 ...end up with a girl like you?
 Well, we met at choir practice about four years ago.
 Freakshow was really shy back then, you know, 'cause of all his hideous boils on his face and neck.
 Sure, sure.
 But he had the most amazing voice, like a baby canary.
 The devil is everywhere Hey, Randy, what, the devil, huh The devil is everywhere Hey, Randy, what After Easter service one day, I told him how much I loved his solo and he finally mustered up the courage to ask me out.
 We've been in love ever since.
 So, are you boys gonna fuck me now or what?
 Rock, paper, scissors to see who goes first.
 Ready?
 Rock, paper...
 Wait a second.
 What about Freakshow?
 What?
 You assume we don't know how to have a good time?
 I just...
 Never mind.
 Rock, paper, scissors.
 Sorry, but if you boys want me, you have to do me at the same time.
 Huh?
 Come on, give me the double stuff.
 I'm not sure we quite understand, Liane.
 I want you both inside me simultaneously.
 One hole or two?
 Whatever you want.
 Sorry.
 No, thank you.
 No, thank you.
 Dude, if it's two holes, it might not be that bad.
 Shotgun anus.
 Forget it!
 I don't want our balls rubbing against each other.
 What, are you kidding?
 No way!
 Forget it.
 How about blow jobs?
 Can we have blow jobs?
 Well, okay.
 Come here.
 Okay.
 I'm going up there.
 I wanna come, too.
 Think you could help me with this?
 You need help?
 Okay, yeah.
 It's a little sticky there.
 You can do it.
 Okay.
 I can do it.
 I can do it.
 Do you wanna play with them?
 Play with them.
 Yeah, let's do that.
 Okay.
 Let's do that.
 Well, boys, I fixed your tire.
 Hi, honey.
 What in the hell are you doing with my wife?
 You said outside that we could have sex with her.
 Shit!
 Shit!
 I most certainly did not.
 Yeah, you did.
 I did not!
 You did.
 Oh, no, I didn't!
 You did, you did.
 You sure?
 You said it.
 My mistake!
 Freakshow.
 Well, since we're all here...
 ...how about a foursome?
 Who wants the first reach-around?
 Okay, let's agree to never talk about what just happened.
 Agreed.
 That's a very good idea.
 Dude, I have no idea where we are.
 What?
 Is that a hitchhiker?
 What the hell?
 Should we pick him up?
 And get chopped to bits?
 Are you crazy?
 You know what?
 We're lost.
 He may know how to get back on the highway.
 Get back on the road.
 This is my car.
 We are not picking up a hitchhiker, man.
 Hey, guys, thanks for picking me up.
 Excuse me, are you Neil Patrick Harris?
 Yep.
 Oh, my God, what are you doing here?
 Holy shit.
 Dude, Doogie Howser M.
 D.
 Was, like, my favorite show growing up.
 You were my idol.
 That's great.
 Could we get going?
 I'm bored as shit back here.
 Go, go.
 Let's go.
 This is a frickin' boring spot.
 So I gotta ask you, Neil, did you ever get it on with Wanda off the set?
 Dude, I humped every piece of ass ever on that show.
 Even the chick who played the hot nurse?
 No.
 I didn't go all the way with her.
 Neil, you wouldn't happen to know how to get on the highway from here, would you?
 Dude, I don't even know where the fuck I am right now.
 I was at this party earlier tonight and some guy hooked me up with this incredible X.
 The next thing I know, I'm being thrown out of a moving car.
 I've been tripping balls ever since.
 That's crazy, dude.
 We've been having a pretty crazy night, too.
 We've just been driving around looking for White Castle, but we keep getting sidetracked.
 Yeah, dude, you fascinate me.
 Forget White Castle.
 Let's go get some pussy.
 Huh?
 It's a fuckin' sausage-fest in here.
 Let's get us some poontang.
 Then we'll go to White Castle.
 No, Neil, you don't understand.
 We've been craving these burgers all night.
 Yeah, I've been craving burgers, too...
 fur burgers.
 Come on, dudes, let's pick up some trim at a strip club.
 The Doogie line always works on strippers.
 Lap dance.
 There's a gas station.
 I'm gonna see if we can get directions.
 We don't need...
 Hurry up, dudes, hurry up.
 I'm losing wood.
 Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
 Chill.
 We'll be right back, Neil.
 We'll be back.
 What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris?
 Why is he so horny?
 I don't know, but we can't let him interfere with our quest.
 Oh, God.
 Shit, these punks again.
 Late-night Math League meeting, homos?
 Extreme!
 Let's go.
 No, no.
 Pies, pies...
 no.
 Dude, what is that?
 Is that a pterodactyl?
 I do not know what that is.
 That was extreme, dude!
 Excuse me, can you tell us how to get to the highway from here?
 Dude, I got this.
 Dude, who knew learning Hindi would actually pay off?
 Guy says the highway is, like, a couple traffic lights from here.
 We should be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes.
 Ready?
 One, two, three!
 No.
 No.
 No.
 Extreme kayaking!
 No!
 Extreme!
 No!
 Man, that was so fuckin' extreme!
 On a scale of 1 to 10, one being not so extreme and ten being extremely extreme, I give this a 9.5!
 Check it out!
 Extreme cheddar!
 Hey.
 Extreme cashier!
 Somebody should do something.
 Yeah, you're right.
 Hey, asshole!
 Why don't you leave that guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something?
 I didn't mean you should do something about it.
 What?
 You're gonna take that?
 What's up with that?
 Huh?
 You're gonna take that?
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 Shit!
 That's right, bitch!
 You just try fuckin' with me one more time!
 Just try it!
 Thank you, come again.
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 Kumar, you okay?
 Yeah, dude, I just hate those assholes.
 You know what?
 Fuck it, I'm hungry.
 Let's just get outta here.
 Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking car?
 Yes.
 I think he did.
 You!
 You had to pick up a hitchhiker!
 Why?!
 Calm down.
 Why did you leave the keys in the car?
 Why?
 Because it would get stolen.
 I figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a trustworthy guy.
 Come on.
 How was I supposed to know he'd fuck us over?
 This whole freaking night, this whole night, is your fault!
 Where are you going?
 I'm going inside to call the police.
 I don't want to talk to you anymore.
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 There's a pay phone across the street if you don't wanna deal with those assholes.
 After we talk to the cops, we're still going to White Castle, right?
 I'm not speaking to you.
 When are they fucking going to develop button technology that will understand urgency?!
 Dude, this is ridiculous.
 Just walk across.
 It'll change in a second.
 There's not a car in sight.
 Just go ahead.
 Fine.
 You want me to cross?
 I will cross.
 If it makes you happy, I will cross.
 I'll do it.
 Shit!
 What...
 Sorry.
 Is there a problem, Officer Palumbo?
 Is there a problem?
 You ever heard of jaywalking?
 Yes, I have.
 I'm really sorry.
 Won't happen again.
 That's great.
 I'm writing you up a ticket.
 A ticket?
 Are you serious?
 Who the fuck are you, shitwad?
 Let me apologize for my friend here.
 I'm very sorry.
 I'm really glad you're here.
 We've had a rough night.
 You know the show Doogie Howser M.
 D.?
 Great show.
 God, I love that show.
 "Doogie." Neil Patrick Harris stole my car tonight.
 Hey, NPH wouldn't do that, all right?
 Give me some I.D.
 Excuse me, how can you give him a ticket for jaywalking?
 It's 2:30 in the morning.
 There's not a car around here.
 Kumar, shut up.
 That's not the kind of tone you want to use on a cop who can bust your ass.
 Bust my ass?
 Yeah, Koo-mar.
 Bust your ass.
 What kind of name is that anyhow?
 Koo-mar.
 What is that, like, five O's or two U's?
 No, it's actually one U.
 Yeah, bullshit.
 Whatever happened to good old American names like Dave or Jim?
 Harold.
 Harold.
 Are you kidd...
 Now that's a great name.
 Let me take care of this.
 You should be proud of that name, son.
 As you were, ladies.
 $220?!
 Are you crazy?!
 Kumar, if you don't stop...
 No, I understand exactly what's going on here.
 Excuse me, officer, let me take a couple of guesses.
 I'm really sorry...
 Get your hands down!
 Okay, alright.
 No sudden moves.
 Back it up!
 You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right?
 Absolutely right.
 Used to pick on guys like us every day, right?
 With pleasure.
 Then graduation day came, and we went to college, and you went nowhere, and you thought, "Hey, how can I still give them shit?
 I know, I'll become a cop." Well, congratu-fuckin'-lations.
 Your dream has come true.
 Now, why don't you just take this quiet little Asian guy with the Anglicized name that treats you so well and give him a couple of other tickets?
 Better yet, just take him to jail.
 Better idea.
 Why don't you just arrest him?
 Does that work out for you okay, Harold?
 "Great American name, Harold." Let's go, Harold.
 Thanks to your buddy, we're going downtow...
 Oh, shit.
 Well, thank you so much for being understanding about Bradley.
 I promise you he won't ever do it again.
 I'm sure he won't.
 Right, Brad?
 Yes, sir, Officer Palumbo, sir.
 Mommy, can we go home?
 Get in the car, Bradley Thomas.
 Bye, Brad.
 Are you gonna do something about my car?
 First our top story.
 The search for the escaped cheetah continues tonight.
 It was last spotted in Randolph County.
 South of...
 So what are you in here for?
 For being black.
 Seriously.
 I am serious.
 You wanna know what happened?
 I was walking out of a Barnes & Noble, and a cop stops me.
 Evidently a black guy robbed a store in Newark.
 I told him, "I haven't even been to Newark in months." So, he starts beating me with his gun...
 ...telling me to stop resisting arrest.
 Holy shit!
 What'd you do?
 I kept saying, "I understand I'm under arrest.
 Now please stop beating me." I don't understand how you can be so calm about all this.
 Look at me.
 I'm fat, black, can't dance, and I have two gay fathers.
 People have been messing with me my whole life.
 I learned a long time ago that there's no sense getting all riled up every time a bunch of idiots give you a hard time.
 In the end, the universe tends to unfold as it should.
 Plus I have a really large penis.
 That keeps me happy.
 Hey, hey, listen up, guys!
 Multiple gunshots fired in Millbrook Park.
 Finally, some action.
 I'm goin'!
 No, I'm goin'!
 Lock and load!
 That was strange.
 What the hell was that?
 Rold.
 Is that you?
 Kumar?
 Are the cops still here?
 What the hell are you doing?
 I just called and made up some story about a shooting in Millbrook Park.
 Jesus Christ, what'd you do that for?
 I'm fucking starving.
 I figured I'd bust you out and we'd go get some burgers.
 Forget it.
 I'm not getting into any more trouble.
 I'm already in here because of you.
 Hey, fuck you!
 What did you want me to do, stand there and take the hit?
 You know I've never taken a swing at you, ever.
 Well, I never got your car stolen.
 Fine.
 I'm leaving.
 Fine.
 Harold, how do I get out of here?
 How the hell should I know?
 Shit!
 Oh, God, this isn't good.
 My ass!
 Sure you don't want to get out of here?
 And become a fugitive?
 Are you nuts?
 The guy has all my information.
 So what?
 We'll just take what he wrote down about you and leave.
 Unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to turn in your work tomorrow.
 Fine, hurry up.
 Yes!
 All right, we gotta find keys.
 Oh, yes!
 Sweet!
 I was hoping it would be one of these big ring of keys.
 Kumar, hurry the fuck up.
 All right, yeah.
 Yes!
 Dude!
 Hey, what's that smell?
 What smell?
 Kumar.
 If we still have time.
 We might still get by Every time I think about it I wanna cry With bombs and the devil.
 And the kids keep comin' No way to breathe easy.
 No time to be young But I tell myself that I'm doin' all right There's nothin' left to do at night But go crazy on you Crazy on you Let me go crazy.
 Crazy on you Crazy on you Bitch!
 Learn how to fuckin' make coffee, you fuckin' whore!
 Let me go crazy.
 Crazy on you I love you.
 No, no, no.
 No, baby, come on.
 Hey, Kumar.
 Kumar!
 Where are you...
 Kumar!
 Still in jail, asshole!
 Come here!
 Kumar!
 The cops...
 You thought you'd get away with it, huh?
 I was in bed.
 I didn't fire any gun.
 I swear.
 Hey, Jackson's trying to escape!
 What are you talking about?
 I'm just sitting here.
 He's trying to break free!
 Get him!
 Aw, shit.
 Don't move!
 Stop resisting!
 We need backup now!
 He's got a gun.
 That's not a gun, that's a book.
 Secure the book!
 Book is secure.
 You bring this filth in here?
 What is this shit?
 Wait, wait.
 We gotta do something about this.
 We're gonna teach you how to read now, brother.
 If I were you, I'd leave as soon as possible.
 Whose hand is that?
 Thanks, man.
 Jesus Christ.
 Thanks for getting me out, man.
 No problem.
 The burgers wouldn't taste as good if you weren't there.
 Hey, look at this.
 It's like we went from being completely poor to being millionaires.
 What was that?
 Probably just a coyote.
 Aren't people supposed to be scared of coyotes?
 That's just 'cause they sound scary, man.
 In one-on-one combat, either of us could take down a coyote, no problem.
 What?
 Now, cheetahs are another story.
 We're gonna die.
 No, now hold on.
 Cheetahs are used to eating gazelles and shit.
 They're not known for eating humans.
 That is a corpse.
 We're gonna die.
 Shit!
 That's not a good sign.
 Maybe if we just stay really, really still, he'll just go away.
 Okay.
 Just stay really still.
 Don't move, okay?
 Just stay right there.
 Very good.
 Good job.
 This isn't working.
 He's mauling me!
 He's mauling me!
 Dude, I told you not to bring the beef jerky.
 He likes me.
 Hey, Rold, I have an idea.
 You gotta be kidding me, man.
 Uh-uh.
 This is either a really smart move or by far the stupidest thing that we have ever tried.
 Well, we're about to find out.
 Mush!
 I told you this was...
 Oy vey!
 Dude, am I really high, or is this actually working?
 Both!
 This is awesome!
 We're gonna be at White Castle in no time!
 That was close, huh, Roldy?
 Harold.
 I need you, Harold.
 I need you, Harold.
 Come here.
 Come here, Harold.
 Maria.
 Come, Harold.
 I'm coming, baby!
 I want you to hold me.
 Papi.
 I need you.
 Baby, I'm a-comin'!
 Not so fast.
 Watch out, watch out Come on!
 Bullets...
 my only weakness.
 How did you know?
 Maria Harold.
 Maria.
 Maria Maria.
 Maria Watch out, watch out Watch out, watch out What the hell are you doing?
 God!
 You've been out cold for the past half-hour.
 I figured maybe if I did some gay shit you'd wake up.
 If we did some gay shit?
 Where are we?
 Didn't we come here on a cheetah?
 Where's the cheetah?
 It ran away.
 Listen, forget about the cheetah, okay?
 I have some bad news and some worse news.
 Give me the worse news first.
 I looked at some of the road signs up there, and it looks like the cheetah took us in the wrong direction.
 Shit!
 Yeah.
 Shit!
 Yeah.
 All right, what's the bad news?
 Your laptop's completely destroyed.
 What?
 Why didn't...
 Why didn't you tell me...
 How is that not the worse news?
 The laptop situation really only affects you, whereas the White Castle situation affects both of us equally.
 Oh, no!
 Oh, no!
 All my work was saved on this computer.
 Now I gotta go back to the office and redo it.
 Exactly.
 First we'll go to White Castle...
 Forget about White Castle.
 There is no time.
 Car.
 Hello.
 Over here!
 Shit.
 Whoa.
 Yeah.
 Um...
 All right, we'll get a pay phone, get a cab back to your office, all right?
 Come on.
 You all right?
 Hey, check this out!
 Yeah, nice!
 Hey, Apu!
 Jesus.
 These guys are frickin' everywhere.
 Who's looking after the Kwik-E-Mart while you're gone?
 You two going to share a curry Slurpee?
 Fucking assholes.
 Dude, check it out.
 It's Rosenberg and Goldstein.
 I want that.
 What, a Hot Dog Heaven super chili cheese dog?
 No.
 I want that feeling.
 The feeling that comes over a man when he gets exactly what he desires.
 I need that feeling.
 Are you saying what I think you're saying?
 We gotta go to White Castle.
 Yes, yes!
 I knew you had it in you, dude.
 Yo, is that Cindy Kim?
 Oh, dude, you should've boned her when you had the chance, man.
 Check it out.
 Why don't you guys just leave us alone?
 What are you gonna do about it, Mr Miyagi?
 That's extreme, man!
 There's no sense getting all riled up every time a bunch of idiots give you a hard time.
 The universe tends to unfold as it should.
 Nothing.
 Fucking extreme!
 I'm so sick of their bullshit.
 Don't worry.
 The universe tends to unfold as it should.
 What is that, some fortune cookie?
 Hey, I got a plan.
 Follow my lead, okay?
 Your lead?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Whoa, what are you doing?
 Oh, shit!
 Those pricks!
 This is your plan?
 It's working, isn't it?
 Come on, come on!
 Get 'em, guys!
 Jerk-offs!
 My truck!
 Thank you, come again.
 Dude, that was so not extreme.
 I know, Extreme Sport Punk Number One.
 I know.
 Let's find us some tunes, baby.
 "Cole's Extreme Mix, Volume 5"?
 What is this shit?
 And I need you now tonight Those guys are fuckin' posers.
 And if you'll only hold me tight Baby.
 Baby.
 The stars are shining foryou And just like me.
 I'm sure that they adore you Baby.
 Baby Go walking through the forest Things'll go your way Hold on for one more day I know that there is pain But you hold on for one more day And you break free from the chains Yeah.
 I know that there is pain But you hold on for one more day And you break free right from the chains Someday somebody's gonna make you wanna turn around And say good-bye Say good-bye Until then, baby Are you gonna let 'em hold you down and make you cry?
 Don't you know things can change Things'll go your way If you hold on for one more day Hold on Bingo.
 Yeah, dude!
 Cherry Hill, man.
 We're almost there.
 I told you, man!
 I found 'em, and I'm gonna need backup.
 Oh, shit.
 Shit.
 Fudge, dude.
 Are you kidding me?
 What the hell are you doing?
 I'm not going back to jail, man.
 We've come too far.
 Now buckle up.
 Buckle up!
 We got a chase on our hands.
 Ready?
 Yeah.
 For what?
 Oh, shit!
 Where the fuck you takin' us?
 Just hold on.
 What the...
 It's a good thing I have an empty stomach or else I'd puke right now.
 We're gonna make it.
 Everything's gonna be all ri...
 Oh, my God!
 Oh, shit.
 Holy shit.
 Put her in reverse.
 Hurry!
 Shit!
 Let's go out the back.
 I'll go first.
 Don't shake the car!
 Well, hurry up!
 Hey, Roldy, check it out.
 Shit, shit!
 We're trapped, man!
 Whoa.
 Not necessarily.
 No.
 No, not a chance.
 I'd rather turn myself in than die.
 No, dude, I know exactly how to do that.
 I used to do it with my dad all the time when I was a kid.
 Forget it!
 I'm not risking my life over a bunch of hamburgers, man.
 So you think this is just about the burgers, huh?
 Let me tell you, it's about far more than that.
 Our parents came to this country, escaping persecution, poverty, and hunger.
 Hunger, Harold.
 They were very, very hungry.
 They wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals, a land filled with hamburger stands.
 And not just one type of hamburger, okay?
 Hundreds of types with different sizes, toppings, and condiments.
 That land was America.
 America, Harold!
 America!
 Now, this is about achieving what our parents set out for.
 This is about the pursuit of happiness.
 This night...
 is about the American dream.
 Dude, we can stay here, get arrested, and end our hopes of ever going to White Castle.
 Or we can take that hang glider and make our leap towards freedom.
 I leave the decision up to you.
 I hate you, Kumar.
 Tilt forward.
 Roldy.
 What?
 Don't worry.
 Everything's gonna be fine.
 All right.
 Good job, Rold.
 Keep running.
 Thank you.
 Hey, Roldy, there's something I forgot to tell you.
 I've never hang-glided before.
 What?!
 Jump!
 Oh, my God!
 Dude, it's working!
 Oh, my God!
 Yeah!
 Good news.
 I just found enough dope in the car to put these skateboard punks in jail for the next couple of years.
 Dude, we're so high right now.
 We're not low.
 All right, I'm bringing her in.
 Right, left, left.
 Perfect!
 Shit!
 Shit!
 God!
 I'm gonna kill you!
 Look!
 We made it, dude.
 Looks like you guys had some night, huh?
 I want 30 Slyders, 5 French fries, and 4 large Cherry Cokes.
 I want the same, except make mine Diet Cokes, Chuck.
 Wow.
 Well, that comes to $46.75.
 Dude, where's my money?
 You don't have money?
 Dude, are you kidding me?
 No.
 I gave mine to that asshole at Princeton.
 Fuck!
 Fuck that hippie fuck!
 No!
 Dude, this isn't happening!
 We didn't make it here, and now we're broke!
 No, no, no, no!
 Guys, let me pay for it.
 It's the least I can do.
 The hell are you doing here?
 You guys kept talking about White Castle last night so much, it made me start to crave it, too.
 Dude, where's my car?
 Where's his car, dude?
 Yeah, sorry about that.
 I told you last night I was tripping balls.
 I don't know what came over me.
 Your car's in the parking lot.
 Here are your keys.
 Do you realize what the hell we had to go through after you took the car?
 Yeah.
 It was a dick move on my part.
 That's why I'm paying for your meal.
 Prick.
 Thanks, I guess.
 Here's 50 bucks for the burgers and 200 for the car.
 What happened to my car?
 I made some love stains in the back seat.
 You'll see.
 Anyway, nice meeting you guys.
 I'll catch you later.
 Where are you going?
 Wherever God takes me.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 Let's do this together.
 Damn, that hit the spot.
 That was the best meal of my life.
 Mine, too.
 You know what, dude?
 I think I may actually go to my interview today.
 Are you serious?
 You know, my whole life I've just been scared of being one of those nerdy Indian guys turned doctor, but tonight got me thinking.
 There are far worse things in this world than being tapped for having a natural ability in medicine.
 Chick magnet.
 Chick magnet Plus, how cool was that, saving that dude's life last night?
 It was somewhere between that, getting yelled at by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick Harris that I realized that I've always wanted to be a doctor but I've just been too scared to admit it to myself.
 Billy, you paying for this?
 Yeah, I'll be there...
 Good, 'cause if he wasn't, you would.
 Are you listening to me, Roldy?
 I'm having a major epiphany here.
 I'll be right back.
 You're unlike any other woman I've ever met.
 What the fuck is going on here?
 Harold?
 What happened to you, man?
 Never mind me.
 What the fuck are you doing here?
 I thought you and J.D.
 Were busy all night with clients.
 Isn't that why I had to do your work?
 Henry, what the hell's going on?
 Back off, cock boy.
 What I said to him goes double for you.
 Did you just call me cock boy?
 Yeah, you know I did.
 You're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback.
 You think I'm not quick enough.
 Guy thinks I'm not quick enough.
 Well, I've got news for you.
 I am quick enough...
 ...cock boy!
 Listen, Harold, I'm really sorry.
 Don't bother with him.
 We'll take it up with Berenson tomorrow.
 What are you gonna tell Berenson?
 That I'm your workhorse?
 That you guys think you can party all weekend, leave the work to the quiet Asian guy in the office?
 No, you don't understand.
 No, you don't understand.
 I'm not doing your work for you anymore.
 And if either one of you douche bags ever tries to pull this shit again, I'll go to Berenson myself.
 I'll tell him what's really going on.
 And I'll tell the whole office how you both caught gonorrhea from that prostitute in Atlantic City.
 If you'll excuse me, boys, I gotta get going.
 Kumar.
 See you boys at the office on Monday.
 Excuse me.
 Dude, that was awesome!
 Where the hell did that come from?
 I don't know.
 Eating those delicious burgers made me feel like a new man.
 You know what?
 Now I'm actually looking forward to going to work this week.
 No shit.
 You know, you might be worthwhile after all.
 I'm not worthless.
 Hey, so those dudes really have gonorrhea?
 Beats me.
 Hey.
 Let's get going.
 What's the rush, dude?
 I don't have my interview for a couple of hours.
 I got some unfinished business to take care of.
 I thought those guys were gonna do the work.
 No, unfinished business.
 Maria.
 Still not following you.
 Get in!
 So you don't even have a plan.
 Dude, I got love on my side, man.
 Trust me.
 When I see Maria, I'm gonna know exactly what to say.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 It looks like you guys have had some night.
 Shit.
 You know what?
 I left my lighter in your car.
 Do me a favor and run down and get it for me, please?
 I gotta urinate.
 You sure got a lot of baggage.
 Maria, wait.
 I know this is gonna seem completely out of the blue, and I know you don't know me very well...
 or, um, at all.
 But let me tell you the best part of my day is.
 I come home from work and I walk through this lobby, and on days that I'm lucky enough, I spend ten seconds in this elevator with you.
 I had the craziest night of my life tonight, and I guess I learned that if you want something or someone, you have to go for it.
 And if Liane can marry a guy like Freakshow and I can hang-glide and I can ride a cheetah, then I guess...
 Oh, fuck it.
 Girl, I'm spendin' my dimes Give me a minute.
 This is crazy.
 That was...
 l'm sorry.
 I don't even know you.
 I had White Castle, so I'm a little dizzy.
 We don't ever speak.
 We don't talk, so that was inappropriate.
 Oh, fuck it.
 I wanna get next to you I wanna get next to you Okay.
 Now you just have to work on your timing.
 Where are you going?
 Amsterdam.
 I'll be back in ten days.
 But I'll see you when I get back?
 Yeah, let's do that.
 Bye, Harold.
 Bye.
 Bye.
 I'll see you later.
 She touch your penis?
 What?
 What happened?
 Nothing much, really.
 Just a little kiss action.
 Nice.
 Nice!
 Yeah.
 She's going to Amsterdam.
 She'll be back in ten days.
 We gotta go.
 Where?
 Amsterdam, man.
 We gotta get our bags packed...
 Amsterdam?
 ...and frickin' take the next flight out.
 Are you freaking out of your mind?
 What about your interview?
 Dude, whatever.
 I'll tell my dad to reschedule it.
 He won't have a problem as long as I take it seriously for a change.
 We gotta freakin' go to Europe and find Maria.
 Dude, she's coming back in ten days.
 It's not like I'm never gonna see her again.
 Listen, for a hot chick, ten days in Europe can be the kiss of death, okay?
 She's gonna have all these suave, sophisticated guys all over her.
 When she gets back, she may not be available.
 Forget it.
 I'll see her when she comes back.
 Hey, Roldy.
 You do realize what's legal in Amsterdam, don't you?
 Oh, yeah.
 In today's headlines, Rutgers professor Tarik Jackson and attorney Nathaniel Banks are suing the state of New Jersey for racial discrimination and police brutality.
 My family and I are outraged and will settle for nothing less than justice.
 I still trust and love all white people, all of them.
 And Asians.
 And Asians.
 And a few Mexicans as well.
 Several of the officers suspected of brutality were taken into custody earlier this morning.
 Run away, you mother...
 No black mother...
 gonna get away with this, so...
 all y'all.
 You can suck my...
 Police in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, have just arrested a gang of hooligans who are suspected of terrorizing numerous strip malls and convenience stores.
 Officer Thurmond Brucks found their abandoned car, which contained a large bag of marijuana.
 And in other news, the Muckleburg Police Department are still looking for a fugitive who escaped from the police station last night with a companion believed to be his accomplice.
 Police have released sketches of the two fugitives which they believe to be extremely accurate.
 Nice!
My name is Happy Gilmore.
Ever since I was old enough to skate, I loved hockey.
I wasn't really the greatest skater.
But that didn't keep my dad from teaching me...
...the secret of making a great slap shot.
My dad worshipped hockey.
My mom didn't.
So she moved to Egypt, where there's not a hockey rink within miles.
Dad took ne to games to see our favorite player...
...Terry O'ReiIIy, 'The Tasnanian DeviI'.
He wasn't a big guy, but he feared nobody, just Like me.
Handsone feIIow, huh?
He said when I grew up, I could be anything.
But all I ever wanted to be was a hockey player.
My childhood was going great, but Life is fuII of surprises.
After the funeraI, I was sent to Live with my grandma in Waterbury.
I was nervous, since I didn't know her that well.
She dressed Like Gene Sinnons from KISS to cheer ne up.
She's the sweetest person in the world.
After my dad died, I developed a short fuse.
That kid stoIe ny party bIower.
Instead of asking for it back, I hit hin in the head repeatedIy...
with a hanner.
Most of the time, I was quick to say I was sorry.
Years Iater, I played junior hockey and still hold two Ieague records...
...nost time spent in a penaIty box...
...and I was the onIy guy to ever try to stab someone with his skates.
After I graduated, I had a lot of different jobs.
I was a road worker...
...a janitor...
...a security guard...
...a gas station attendant...
...and a plunber.
Lately, I've been working construction.
It's not bad.
I'm a good shot with a nall gun.
But one day ny boss, Mr Larson, got in the way.
ApparentIy, he aIso has a short fuse.
Look at the nonster.
He got in a few Lucky punches, but I feeI I won the fight.
Anyway, those jobs weren't for ne.
I was put on this planet for one reasonto play hockey.
It's my puck, baby!
Don't you ever touch my puck!
Is that Gilmore again?
How nany times has he tried out?
At Least ten times.
He has a lot of intensity.
Not a strong skater, though.
Nor the best puck handIer.
But, ny God...
What a shot.
It that goal regulation size or what?!
Number one...
...number fiftytwo...number sixteen...
They saw my power.
They won't dog ne this year.
...number nine...
...and number fortythree.
The rest of you...
...better Luck next year.
Coach, what's going on?
What about ne?
Gilmore.
I called your number, didn't I?
No, you didn't.
Well, better Luck next year.
That wasn't very nice!
You think you're better than me?!
Where you going?
I got Subway.
I aIready ate.
I knew the guy working there, so we got extra neatballs.
Great.
I got to run.
Can you stay?
I had a rough day.
Bye.
When will you be back?
Never.
Terry, wait!
Wait!
Hold on a second, babe.
You're not going for good, are you?
You're going nowhere and taking ne with you.
ALL you ever taIk about is being a pro hockey player, but you're not any good.
I an good!
You know what?
You're a Lousy kindergarten teacher!
I saw the finger paintings you bring honethey suck!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
They're excellent finger paintings.
Please don't go.
I'm not spending the rest of ny Life with a Loser.
I'm gone.
Good!
Get the hell out of my Life!
Who needs you?
Beat it!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
I just yell 'cause I get so scared.
Scared of being a nobody.
Why don't you cone back upstairs, honey?
I'II give you the oId snoochysnoo kissywissy.
You know Happy will make everything okay.
I want to kiss you all over And over and again I want to kiss you all over Till the night cIoses in Till the night cIoses in Terry!

Hey, you don't want breakfast?
Grandma?
Put that down!
It's my grandmother's!
Cut it out, kid.
We're just doing our job.
What are you talking about?
Your grandmother hasn't paid taxes in years.
Grandma, you didn't pay your taxes?
I would have, but I didn't have any money.
Where are you taking her stuff?
I'm not taking her stuff, the governement is.
It's not like I'm taking her stuff over to my place.
Don't get nad at ne.
But she's an oId Lady.
Look at her.
She's oId.

Her stuff is now our stuff.

Now you'II really be nad.
I'm taking the house, too.
My grandfather built this house with his bare hands.
My Grandma's been here over years.
You can't take her house.
Mrs Gilmore owes the IRS $ in back taxes.
We have to take the house.
If you can't repay the money in days, we seII the house to someone else.
You hate ne, don't you?
No, I don't hate you.
He hates ne.
Don't worry things will be okay.

...who can hit the ball haIf as far as you.
You got real talent.
That's nice of you to say, but I trained all my Life to play hockey.
Golf is no differentrequires talent, seIfdiscipIine.
Golf requires goofy pants and a fat ass.
TaIk to ny neighbora great golfer.
Huge ass.
I bet your neighbor can't drive the ball yards.
I bet your neighbor doesn't have a shot to get on the Pro Tour.
How would I do that?
You win the Open tomorrow, you're on the Pro Tour.
Then, who knows?
Maybe you'II win the Tour Chanpionship.

It's all in the hips.
ALL in the hips.
It's all in the hips.

Just easing the tension.
Just easing the tension.

Good.
Now we just worry about putting.
Oh, yeah.
Putting.
Remember what I said.
Use your shoulders to push the ball, not the arns.
Don't break the wrist.
Whoa, you're confusing ne.
Just Iet ne put the ball in the hoIe.
Is he kidding?
This is pathetic.
Good shot.
It's about time.
True.
I just couldn't get the ball in the hoIe.
I wanted to, but I couldn't.
He shoots, he scores!
That was nuch easier than putting.
I should try and do that every time.
Good pIan.
Did you see that?
Yes.
Nice.
He got a hoIe in one on a par four.
I said I saw it.
I hope he wins.
He's a pubIicist's drean.
A guy who can drive the ball that farhe could really draw a crowd.
So could a golfer with an arn growing out of his ass.
Now, you make this one in four or Iess shots...
...you win the tournament.
Four shots.
Think of it this way.
The other tean has puIIed their goalie.
It's wide open.
ALL you have to do is tap it in.
I can do that.
Don't worry.
You're doing fine.
ALL you have to do is tap it in.
Just tap it in.
Just tap it in.
Just tap it in.

But if you beat hin up, I'II have to expIain to the papers...
...why the new guy beat up Shooter McGavin.
More work for ne.
I don't want to do that.
Forget about Shooter.
He's just threatened by you.

That's nice of you to say.
So, I'm going to go change now.

Well, time to play golf.
Good Luck.
I'm a hockey player playing golf today.

Working it.
On the th green, Shooter McGavin putts for the win.
His crowd seens unusually snall for this type of nonent.
Most people are over watching Happy Gilmore.
He's the taIk of the course...
...with his huge drives and bizarre behavior.
He's on the th green right now, having trouble cIosing out his day.
Happy, the ball has its own energy or Life force, if you will.
Its naturaI environnent is in the hoIe.
Why don't you send hin hone?
His bags are packed.
He has his pIane ticket.
Bring hin to the airport.
Send hin hone.
Send hin hone.
I'II send hin hone.
It's time to go hone, ball.
Son of a bitch ball!
Why didn't you go hone?!
That's your hone!
Are you too good for your hone?!
Answer ne!
Suck ny white ass, ball!
Draft a press reIease stating Gilmore is being thrown off the Tour.
I want to see it by : p.n.
You're righthis behavior is conpIeteIy unacceptabIe.
But golf has been waiting for a player Like this.
A coIorfuI, enotionaI, working cIass hero.
I will not toIerate this behavior.
Gilmore is gone.
I got a call fron the Dallas Open.
They're deIuged with calls fron people who want to see Happy.
They soId out.
AIready?
I know he's a IittIe rough.
Let ne work with hin.
Okay.
Fine.
But he's your responsibiIity.
If he cIeans up, he can stay.
If he doesn't, it's your ass.
And any more of this...
...and he's gone.
Shooter!
Shooter!
What do you think of Happy Gilmore?
I didn't see hin play.
I was too busy winning.
But a yard drive is inpressive.
Yeah.
Where did he finish again?
Dead Last?
Yeah, he had a good day.
Did he really make a yard ace?
Where's ny check?
We nall then next week.
I want nine now.
I don't have any checks.
He got one.
Give ne one of then big ones, I don't care.
Give ne a beer, paI.
Put that on ny tab.
You were the taIk of the tournament, Gilmore.
Wow, thanks a Iot.
You sure crush the ball at the tee.
You'd do well in a Longdrive contest.
You'd make good money, traveIing, hustIing at driving ranges.
I know what you're doing right now...
...and I don't Like it.
So just shut your trap before I put ny foot in it.
Don't turn your back on ne.
Listen, this is Shooter's tour.
I worked hard, paid ny dues now it's Shooter's turn.
Shooter won't Iet his reign at the top be spoiIed by sone freak.
Did you call ne a freak?
I was on this tour for one reason money.
Now I got a new one kicking your ass.
I'd Like to see you try.
Let's do it.

What's going on here?
I was Looking for the other haIf of this bottIe.
Oh, there's sone of it right there.
Why don't you put it down?

Just stay out of ny way.
Or you'II pay.
Listen to what I say.
Why don't I go eat sone hay?
I could make things out of cIay and Iay by the bay.
What do you say?
CaIn down or you'II get kicked off the Tour.
That can't happen.
It can, and I don't want it to.
You could be a big star.
I just want to make sone money.
You won't be around Long enough to do that if you don't behave.
What do you mean by 'behave'?
No swearing, no throwing clubs...
...and especialIy no hitting other players.
You mean no fun.
You can have fun.
That's why I think people cone to see you.
But keep it within reason.
I will work on what you call behaving.
But I won't act Like a stiff.
Fine.
Thank you.

This nan is destroying golf.
I saw two fat bikers in the woods off having sex.
How can I chip with that going on?
Kick hin off the Tour.
He hasn't broken any ruIes.
He's a disgrace to the game!
Yes, but our ratings are up.
We're attracting new, youthfuI sponsors.
I'm sorry, Shooter.
There's nothing I can do.
Then I'II have to take care of this nyseIf.
Grandma, I cane in th place.

Goodbye, darling.
We should go on that date.
I've been pretty good IateIy.
Oh?
I hear you broke a rake and threw it in the woods.
I didn't break it.
I was testing its durabiIity.
I put it in the woods because it's nade of wood...
...and he should be with his faniIy.
At Least I didn't punch anyone.
Okay, we'II go on a date.
But just as friends.
SIow down.
I don't want to be more than friends.
I just net you.

For Happy Gilmore, anything.
You played ice hockey?
Shut up.
Oh, ny God...power fallure.
It's very scary in here.
Did you pIan this?
No.
I thought we were going to be just friends.
What?
Friends Iisten to 'EndIess Love' in the dark.
This song reninds ne of seventh grade.
It reninds ne of ny grandmother.
That's kind of weird.
She took ne to see this novie.
I had the biggest crush on Brooke ShieIds.
My Grandma toId ne I should write her a Ietter, so I did.
I got a Ietter back fron Brooke two weeks Iater.
But it was in ny grandmother's handwriting.
Your Grandma sounds sweet.
She is sweet.
That's why I feeI so terribIe.
Why?
No, forget it.
You can teII ne.
She's stuck in a nursing hone.
The IRS repossessed her house.
That's awfuI.
That's why I joined the Tour.
I'm cIose to getting her house back.
Don't teII anyone.
I'm kind of enbarrassed.
Don't worry.
I won't teII anyone.
I'II make you a bet.
Do you aIways carry a puck?
Yeah.
Now, if you get that puck in the net over there...
...I'II never bother you again.
But if you niss...
...you have to give ne a big, fat kiss.
And you have to pretend you Like it.
Really?
Good Luck.
Shit.

I'II give it all to you My Love, ny Love, ny Love My endIess Love Welcome to soggy San Francisco...

Hello, Happy.
I'm Bob Barker.
What an honor.
Nice to neet you.

Who an I really playing with?
In a ProAn, each golfer plays with a ceIebrity.
Wow.
Nick FaIdo and I won Last year.
I'd Like to win this year.
I'II do ny best.
Hey, Gilmore?
You suck, you jackass.
Shut the hell up.
I'd Love to punch that guy in the face, but I'd get in trouble.
You get this on 'Let's Make A DeaI'?
'The Price Is Right', Happy.
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
It happens.
Let's play sone golf.
Jackass.
The club went further than the ball.
What was that all about?
It's just that it's rainy and that guy....
It just sIipped.
Get a bIanket and suntan Iotion, 'cause you'II never get off that beach.
Just the way you never got into the NHL, you jackass!
The green's that way.
You will not make this putt, you jackass.
Nice shooting, soIdier.
ALL right, Happy...
...nice and easy.
That was not nice and easy.
That guy is driving ne crazy.
What's driving ne crazy is you not getting the ball in the hoIe.
Don't push ne, Bob.
Now's not the time.
Jackass.
This guy sucks!
We haven't seen Gilmore play this badIy since his first day on tour.
He and Bob Barker are now dead Last.
You should be working at the snack bar, not playing golf.
Relax, Bob.
There is no way you could have been as bad at hockey as you are at golf.
Okay, Iet's go.
You Like that, oId nan?!
You want a piece of ne?
I don't want a piece of you.
I want the whoIe thing!
Now you're gonna get it, Bobby!
The price is wrong, bitch.
I think you've had enough.
No?
Now you've had enough.
Bitch.
That couldn't have gone better.
Instead of hitting you, he hits Bob Barker.
Perfect.
So, see you at the next tournament?
No need.
This was on nationaI TV.
Gilmore is gone.
Let's get something at the Red Lobster.
My treat.
Sone other time.
I thought we were friends.
We are.
I just have to go.
I'II be at the Red Lobster in case you change your nind.
God bIess!
There you are.
Happy Gilmore, cone on down!
Thank you, Shooter.
Sit down.
So you got in a fight with a game show host on nationaI TV.
That is not entertainnent.
This is not hockey, no natter how nuch you want it to be.
I know that and I'm sorry.
But there was a guy out there...
...giving ne crap.
It took all I had not to hit hin.
So you headbutt Bob Barker?
Who won that fight, anyway?
Enough, Shooter.
The board has done the foIIowing: Fined you $ and suspended you for one nonth.
What?!
I got to play!
What?!
Kick hin off the Tour.
The board thinks that night be extrene...
...considering the fact that our ratings were...
...the highest we've ever had.
My grandmother's house got repossessed.
If I don't win more prize money, they'II seII it to someone else.
Whoopdeedoo.
Get out.
It's over.
My grandmother will never see her house again.
But you've nade a Iot of money.
You could buy her a nice condo.
My grandfather didn't buiId any condos with his bare hands.
Dann it, I hate that Bob Barker.
There nust be another way to get the $ .
I don't want to taIk about it.
I falled, okay?
Let ne just enjoy the one thing that makes ne a bit happy...

What team do you play for?
Easy.
Face it, Happy.
You are a golfer.
I did this to get Grandma's house back.
Now I can.
No regrets.
What do you think she wants moreto get her house back or see you succeed?
Maybe she can have both.
Hey, Shooter.
The Tour Chanpionship is next week.
If I beat you, I get the house.
You beat ne, I'II quit.

You're on.
But you're in trouble.

I can't do it!
Cone with ne, Happy.
Cone on!
You suck, you stupid cIown!
Remember, this isn't hockey.
You don't play with raw enotion.
You can't putt angry.
You nust cIear your nind of everything else and stay focused.
How can I do that?
Think of a place that's really perfect.
Your own happy place.
Go there and all your anger will disappear.
Then putt.
Happy place.

There nay be professionaIs...
...vying for the titIe of world's best...
but in the ninds of the spectators, there are onIy two.
Tour kingpin Shooter McGavin...
...and bad boy Happy Gilmore, just off suspension.
Wouldn't you know it?
They've been paired together.
I have sone good interior design ideas for Grandma's house.
You know the bedroon next to the stairs?
Yeah, that was ny roon.
I'm turning it into ny trophy roon.
It just nay not be big enough.
ALL right.
You know what's pathetic?
You've been playing golf all your Life.
Let ne show you how we do it in the pros.
That's got to hurt.
Happy Iearned how to putt.
Uhoh.
Here's a free Iesson.
Can't Iearn that on a hockey rink.
Sonebody's cLoser.
After one day, Shooter McGavin is Leading.
But the big surprise is young Happy Gilmore...
...nipping at his heeIs, tralling by onIy one stroke.
Shooter fron the sand.
Playing Like he really wants that jacket.
Happy Gilmore answers back with a birdie.
Happy with a Long eagIe opportunity.
It's good!
And Shooter can't beIieve it!
He is now tied with Happy Gilmore!
Uhoh.
A IittIe too nuch zip on that one.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
No!
I didn't see that.
Did it go in?
I wasn't watching.
I wasn't watching.
I saw it go up.
Did it go back in?
At the end of day three, Happy Gilmore has the Iead.
One has to be inpressed with the vast inprovenent in his short game.
DonaId, it's Shooter.
Shooter!
It's great to hear fron you!
Want to go to SizzIer and get sone grub?
No, thanks.
Not hungry.
This call is about business.
I need you here in the morning.
It's the finaI day of the Tour Chanpionship...
...and it promises to be a cIassic.
Happy Gilmore Ieads the pack.
Is this a changing of the guard?
We'II know in hoIes.
Happy is really on today.
There he is.
That worn.
Happy, Look out!
Are you okay?
VoIkswagen.
Jackass!
Jackass!
You have no serious injuries.
Just keep off your feet for a few days.
Forget it.
I have to finish.
Do what you Like.
What do I know?
I'm just a doctor.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
There is no shane in throwing in the toweI.
You nust be carefuI with your heaIth.
Let's just play sone golf.
I knew Happy Gilmore was tough...
...but I can't beIieve he's playing after being hit by a car.
Let's hope it doesn't affect his game.
That's the first time he's falled to outdrive McGavin.
Well, well, well.
Happy Gilmore is hunan after all.
Happy Gilmore is in trouble if he can't hit the Long ball.
If he has a chance...
...of winning today, he nust do it on the green.
He has to focus now.
He has to save this one for par.
That bogey drops hin out of the Iead.
If he wants to stay in this thing...
...he has to caIn down.
Don't worry about your Grandma.
She can Live with nebe ny naid.
Look at the cabbage he's in now.
Things just keep getting worse for Happy Gilmore.
Just remember what Chubbs said.
'Go to a happy place.' 'Go to a happy place.' God!
This Looks Like the end for Happy Gilmore.
Shooter now has a connanding Iead.
Happy, Look who's here.
Grandma.
Happy, you Look upset.
What's wrong?
I stink.
I'm not going to win.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
The house isn't important.
It's just a house.
Stop fraternizing with the help, Gilmore.
Just hit your ball, if you can find it.
Hi, Grandma.
Forget hin.
I just want you to be happy, darling.
ALL right, Grandma.
Grandma wants ne to be happy.
Chin up, Happy.
Don't feeI bad about ne.
I got ny hand back, see?
We've onIy just begun To Live White Iace and promises A kiss for Luck and we're on our way It ain't over yet, McGavin.
The way I see it, we've onIy just begun.
Happy, the Gold jacket's yours.
Shooter will choke.
Unbelievable!
Dann you people!
This is golf, not a rock concert!
Putz!
Happy...

Happy Gilmore has charged in the back nine...
...and is now even with Shooter McGavin.
If Shooter doesn't get out of the funk he's in...
...he nay niss out on the Gold jacket.
Ladies and gentIenen, the th hoIe is a par three, yards.
In the event of a tie, there will be a playoff.
Mr Gilmore, you have the honors.
No natter what, I'm having fun.
You're starting to sound Like a golfer.
I know.
Keep it down.
Nice shot!
Fifteen feet short of the hoIe.
Shooter's ball is in the woods.
Happy's on the th green, where a car driven by a crazed fan...
...ranned the TV tower.
Let ne through I'm Looking for ny ball.
This is golf, okay?
Excuse ne.
Thank you.
Is this your ball?
Yes, it is.
It struck ny foot.

Do I get a drop?
The ruIe says, 'Play it as it Iies.' That's two so far, Shooter.
You can count.
Good for you.
And you can count on ne waiting for you in the parking Iot.
You're still away.
I'm aware of that.
Thank you.

Hey, up here.

If he nisses, Happy can twoputt to victory.
Choke on that, baby!
Shooter.
If Gilmore sinks this, it will cap an amazing coneback.
Great.
Now I have a tower bIocking ny ball.
We'II get it noved and you'II finish tomorrow.

[<pre> Hey, Andy!
What's up, dude?
Hey, Joe.
Hey, Sara.
How you doing?
When you going to get a car?
Hey, why don't you get a car?
I can't afford it.
So, Survivor tomorrow night.
We on?
See you then.
I'll bring a soda.
Hey, enjoy your orange.
Okay, take care.
See you.
Bye-bye.
That guy needs to get laid.
Tell me something I don't know.
Good morning.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Hey.
Good morning, Paula.
Andy.
Excuse me.
I have a question.
What is the difference between Hi and Digital video tapes?
I'm not a salesman, so, I could probably...
Welcome to Smart Tech.
How can I be of service to you?
Well, I was just wondering...
what is the difference between these?
Well, if I'm photographing someone as fine as yourself...
I'd probably go Digital.
Hey, don't worry I've been lied to My God.
Sorry I'm late, man.
No problem.
Oh, man.
I had a weekend.
Yeah?
We went to Tijuana, Mexico, you know...
and we thought it would be fun, you know, to go to this show.
Everyone's, "You gotta check out one of these shows." And, you know, it's a woman fucking a horse.
We get there, and, you know, we think it's gonna be awesome...
and it is not as cool as it sounds like it would be, man.
It's kind of gross.
Yeah.
You think, "A woman fucking a horse "...
and you get there and it's...
a woman fucking a horse.
Yeah.
It was really giving it to her.
And you know what...
to be honest, I felt bad for her.
We all just felt bad for her.
Yeah.
Kind of felt bad for the horse.
Wow, that's something.
So what did you get up to?
You know, I just kind of hung out.
I was...
God, Friday, when I went home...
I really wanted an egg-salad sandwich.
And I was just obsessing about it and I was like: "Man, I'm gonna make one of those." So Saturday I went out and I got, like, a dozen eggs...
and I boiled them all and then I just...
I spent, I don't know, probably three hours...
like, three-and-a-half hours making...
you know, the mayonnaise and the onions and paprika...
and, you know, all the accoutrement.
And then, by the time I was done...
I just really didn't feel like eating it.
I can imagine.
And I didn't have any bread.
So, you know, it was pretty good.
It was a good weekend.
Sounds pretty awesome.
Yeah, it was fine.
Sounds really fun.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool, cool.
Hey, Paula.
Yeah.
I gotta tell you something.
I'm really excited about it.
For the first time today, I woke up...
I came to the store, and I feel confident to say to you...
that if you don't take this Michael McDonald DVD...
that you've been playing for two years straight, off...
I'm going to kill everyone in the store...
and put a bullet in my brain.
David, what do you suggest we play?
I don't care.
Anything.
I would rather watch Beautician and the Beast.
I would rather listen to Fran Drescher for eight hours...
than have to listen to Michael McDonald.
Nothing against him, but if I hear Yah Mo B There one more time...
I'm gonna yah mo burn this place to the ground.
You're such a smart ass.
Get back on the floor.
Fuck you.
This is a great TV.
Nothing beats a plasma.
What are you doing?
That's my customer.
It certainly is not.
When I came upon her, she was unattended.
No, that's my...
Wait.
Go to the checkout there.
Pick up there, please.
She was unattended because I went to the back...
to get the brochure that she requested.
I apologize, but it's too late.
The transaction has been completed.
Then you're gonna give me half the commission.
You'll receive none of the commission.
I need to talk to Paula.
This is crazy.
This is bullshit.
Every time I make a sale, you go crying to Paula.
How about Jesse Jackson?
Old Jesse needs a cause.
Sick of you poaching my customers.
I'm sick of your crybaby bullshit.
You wanna take this shit outside?
Just take it outside and squash it?
Let's stay inside, so everybody can see what a pussy you have, okay?
Because when I remove the blade I keep in my boot from its sheath...
I can't return it until it has spilled blood.
Look, listen to me.
You are fucking with the wrong nigger.
Hey!
You're fucking with the wrong sun-nigger, okay?
Dude, I will hang your old ass by your turban.
Turban now?
Do you see any fucking turban here?
Do I talk like a turban guy?
Do I say, "Hey, Jay, do you want a Slurpee?
You want a Slurpee?" Fuck you, okay?
I was born in Brooklyn.
Brooklyn, okay?
My accent is a fucking Brooklyn accent, okay?
Okay?
All right, man.
Calm down, dude.
Look, you still covering my shift on Friday or what?
If I can keep this commission, with pleasure.
Cool, then.
All right, pop.
No problem.
How about Andy?
No.
Come on, man.
We need, what, five guys...
to play a decent poker game, right?
Yeah.
If we cancel this, I'm gonna have to go...
to some stupid-ass birthday party with Jill...
and that shit ain't happening.
No.
Why not?
He's a really nice guy and all but I'm pretty sure that...
he is a serial murderer.
Who cares, man?
He's a nice guy.
I just wanna get drunk, fucked up, and play some cards.
That's great.
Look, I don't wanna end up a lampshade...
in some creepy apartment, that's what I'm saying.
I don't really see any other options.
Andy.
My man.
You got any plans later on tonight?
Why, do we have to unload the Sony truck?
No, the guys are getting together, we're playing some poker...
thought, you know, you'd wanna play.
With you guys?
Yeah, sure.
That would be cool.
You know how to play, right?
Yeah, I play online sometimes.
We're gonna play in the store.
Great.
Are we allowed to do that?
Absolutely not.
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, so I'm gonna go tell Paula.
I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.
That sounds great.
Cool, I'll see you guys tonight.
Okay.
All right.
Oops.
I almost feel guilty.
No, you don't.
Going down!
Going down!
Dumbass.
And a full house.
Oh, my dukes!
What?
How much fucking online poker do you play, dawg?
For like an hour or two a night, when I'm not playing Halo.
Why did you invite this guy?
He's a fucking ringer, man.
This is hog shit.
You, you're a fucking asshole to tell me to come here.
You tell me he was a nice guy, didn't you?
Well, fuck you people, and fuck you, you and you...
fuck and kiss my big brown fucking ass, okay?
I'm gonna see you tomorrow.
Peace.
All right, man.
Fuck a goat.
Good night.
I love that guy.
Dude, you totally...
Oh, shit, I gotta go.
Damn.
About to go see Ellen in a little bit.
Going now?
Late-night action, huh?
Dude, you know how it goes.
Does your girlfriend know about all these late-night visits?
It's like an unspoken agreement.
Yeah.
It's like a completely and utterly unspoken agreement.
If you knew her, if you knew who I was dealing with...
you wouldn't be saying this shit.
There's nothing you can't do with this woman...
straight up and down.
I've done every single thing...
I could possibly create.
I've literally lubed up...
and made love to the arches of her feet.
All right.
Wow!
Yeah.
Foot fuck!
That's sick, man.
Wow.
That is not sick.
I will give you sick.
Oh, shit.
I was sleeping with a woman recently, she had the...
Her tits were unbelievable.
Oh, man, I love titties.
And so we're doing it and I'm about to finish...
and her dog starts licking my ass.
I swear to God, I have to decide, do I finish or do I stop the dog?
I know your nasty ass.
He finished.
I finished.
And then I stole the dog.
No, I didn't, but...
You know, sometimes, Amy and I would make love...
till it was almost like we weren't two people...
but we were two spirits or something.
Our souls were connected in this way, I can't describe it.
Time stood still.
It was like we were sharing the same heart.
Stop, man!
Why do you always come and kill the vibe with those things?
"Sharing the same heart," that's like some...
Britney Spears shit, man.
This is three grown ass men, don't nobody want to hear that shit.
Yeah, man, come on, nobody wants to hear that shit.
Thank you, Andy.
Dude, you broke up two years ago.
You get over it at some point.
Two years, man.
You need to get past that...
because no ass is worth thinking that much about...
I always say.
Andy, do me a favor.
Would you please help him redeem himself by telling a real sex story?
Yes.
I don't...
You know what, I'm a gentleman and I don't...
I don't kiss and tell.
Fuck it, I raise you.
Nastiest shit you've ever done.
I'm talking about nasty.
Wow.
So many stories are running through my head right now.
I dated this girl...
for a while, and she was really a nasty freak.
She just loved to get down with sex all the time.
She was like, any time of day, she was like: "Yeah, let's go.
I'm so nasty." And I'd be nailing her.
Oh, shit.
She'd be like: "Oh, you're nailing me.
Cool." She talk dirty to you?
She loved to dirty-talk.
Totally into it.
She'd be like: "Yeah, let's screw, let's...
I wanna fuck." God, it was so dirty.
She'd be like, "Me so horny, me love you long time." So...
So what were the titties like?
Yeah, describe her...
Yeah, she had great tits.
No, I mean, like, detailed.
Did she have, like, you know...
them little pink teeny nipples.
Oh, yeah.
Or like the long National Geographic nipples.
You have like the bumpy Braille nipples, the Stevie Wonders.
Yeah, they were nice.
You know, when you, like, you grab a woman's breast and it's...
And you feel it and...
it feels like a bag of sand when you're touching it.
Bag of sand?
You know what I mean.
Why don't we just play?
Why don't you just deal the cards?
What are you talking about?
Have you ever felt a breast before, man?
Yes.
Dude, are you gay?
No, I'm not gay.
I've been with tons of women.
I touched a guy's balls at Hebrew school once.
Dude, it's not a big deal.
You like to fuck guys.
I'm cool.
I got friends who fuck guys, in jail.
No, I'm not gay.
No, I've borked a lot of women in my day.
You've "borked"?
Hold up.
Yo, answer this question: Are you a virgin?
Are you a virgin?
Yeah, not since I was 10.
It all makes sense.
You're a virgin.
I am...
Shut up.
How does that happen?
He's a fucking virgin.
I knew it.
That makes so much sense, man.
Look, he's a virgin.
You guys are hilarious.
All right, come on, don't be mean.
I'm not being mean.
I'm trying to help the partner out.
I'm trying to say I wanna get you laid, dude.
I understand what's going on.
You guys are so up your asses.
From now on, your dick is my dick.
I'm getting you some pussy.
A bag of sand!
Come on, man!
You could do better than that.
God, me so horny?
Me so stupid!
Oh, come on.
It's gonna be fine.
They don't even remember.
Those guys are cool.
This is gonna be bad.
Yeah, well, virgin's not a dirty word.
You know what's a dirty word, is asshole...
and that's what you guys are.
You know, I may not have had sex, but I could fuck you up.
Yeah.
Come on.
Hey, David.
Hey, Andy.
What's up?
Cal, good morning.
Hey, Andy.
Hey.
We're gonna have to get you some punani.
Andy, it's going down, partner.
We're gonna be...
This for you, partner, this for you.
Waves of them coming at you on Friday, Saturday.
By Sunday, your nuts gonna be drained.
Hey, Andy, don't let him bother you.
It's okay not to have sex.
Not everybody is a pussy magnet.
What are you?
?
I'm .
Holy shit, man.
You've got to get on that.
Life isn't about sex.
Life is about children and passion.
Yeah.
And spirit.
Yeah, life's about passion.
It's not about fucking and balls and pussy.
It's about love.
It's about people.
It's about connection.
It's all about connections.
It's not about cock and ass and tits and butthole pleasures.
It's not about butthole pleasures at all.
It's not about this rusty trombone and dirty Sanchez.
Please stop.
And Cincinnati bowtie.
And your pussy juice cocktail and this shit-stained balls.
Mooj, just please stop.
Just relax...
All right.
That's enough, party's over.
Let the virgin get back to work.
Andy!
Andy, come on.
We were just kidding.
Pointless.
Andy, nobody cares that you're a virgin.
Don't be such a baby.
They were just having fun.
They didn't mean anything.
Get away from me, David.
Wait a minute.
Stop following me!
Hold up.
Hold on.
I'm gonna have to quit my job now.
You don't have to quit your job.
You know what, I don't wanna go out with you guys.
Fine.
Okay?
I don't need your help.
Okay, fine, you don't have to go out with us if you don't want.
You know what, I respect women, I love women.
I respect them so much that I completely stay away from them.
Okay.
I have a very fulfilling life.
And now, I am making your silver pants blue.
Get some roadburn, come on!
Come on, sucker!
Now, pretty ladies around the world Got a weird thing to show you Oh, my God!
Hey, Will and Grace, back to work.
Hey, Haziz, can you just give us a second?
We're just kind of in the middle of something.
I'm on my break, okay?
Fuck off, Haziz.
Leave us alone, all right?
Fuck off?
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck off.
Fuck off.
I'm gonna kick you in the nuts, asshole.
Hey, hey!
Watch the language, okay?
I have a family.
Watch how you talk to me!
It's a free country, Bambi.
I can smoke out here if I want to.
Smoke my pole.
You are a very unkind man.
Get inside!
This is not professional.
Paula, this asshole over here...
It's okay.
Paula!
It's all right.
Come on.
You know, it's just...
So, how could this not have happened?
It just never happened.
When I was young, I tried, and it didn't happen.
And then I got older and I got more and more nervous...
because it hadn't happened yet.
And I got kind of...
weirded out about it.
Then it really didn't happen...
and then, I don't know, I just kind of stopped trying.
Do you want to give it another shot?
Maybe it's too late.
Sometimes I feel that it is just too late for me.
No, that's crazy.
You're years old.
You know, is the new .
You wanna spend the next years of your life...
never experiencing sex?
And not just sex, but love...
and a relationship, and laughing and cuddling and all that shit.
I don't know.
I wouldn't know what to do.
Look, you gotta take a risk.
You gotta risk it.
Look at me.
I went out with this girl for four months...
and it was the greatest...
greatest thing in my life.
Until she went down on this guy in an Escalade, I think.
And, you know, instead of saying: "Okay, what am I doing that caused this behavior?
"...
I dumped her.
Stupid decision.
I spent the last two years of my life regretting it.
Why don't you get her back right now?
Because she's dating this pot dealer.
Stupid horrible decision.
But, hey, that's her journey, you know.
I gotta respect that.
I gotta give her the space.
She wants to be some immature little bitch and blow everybody...
that's love, man.
It sounds horrible.
Of course it's horrible.
It's suffering...
and it's pain and it's...
You know, you lose weight...
and then you put back on weight...
and then you call them a bunch of times...
and you try and email and then they move or they change their email...
but that's just love.
Do you realize that this is the first time...
we've spoken for more than, like, seconds?
Uh-huh.
It's kind of nice.
Come out with us this weekend.
No pressure.
We'll just have a good time.
Okay, yeah, I will.
I'll give it a shot.
Great.
But I'm not going to have sex with anybody.
Good, sex should be the last thing on your mind.
[I Got Ants In My Pants playing] Logjam.
Hi.
Shit.
Oh, God.
Sorry.
See you later.
Thanks for the dance.
I'm okay.
It's all right.
Oh, come on, bus!
Oh, come on, dogs!
Shit!
You gotta be kidding me.
I mean, I'm kind of nervous.
I never had oral sex before.
Jennifer told me how to do it.
It's gonna kick ass.
What are you doing?
Okay, just...
We're almost there.
We have one.
Houston, we have one.
You'll pull my fucking hair out!
We did it.
God!
Oh, my God, you came in your pants.
What did you do?
I had some Cream of Wheat.
You know what else is sexy?
What?
Me...
Yeah?
...sucking...
on your...
toe.
That's what you want to suck on?
Yeah.
It's just so big and thick.
Okay.
Yeah.
That tickles.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no.
Your nose is bleeding.
You think?
I'm sorry.
I'm hot.
But, now, you can't have any of this.
You should just give up forever!
[Ain't No Mountain High Enough playing] Cal, what do you think?
Is this too yellow?
No.
What's Curious George like in real life?
Come on, man.
Wow, this is pretty crowded.
Yeah.
Well, it's $ beer night.
Okay, look now.
So, this is what's about to happen, all right?
You about to go run down some drunk chicks, all right?
And don't confuse that with tipsy.
We talking about drunk.
I want vomit in the hair, bruised-up knees.
A broken heel is a plus.
That's what you want to find, okay?
No, Dave already told me I didn't have to have sex tonight.
And now he's gone, so...
Dude, just stop thinking for a minute, all right?
You ain't got to think on this one.
All you got to do is use your instinct.
Show me your instincts.
My head, my heart.
I follow my heart.
Now, I'm gonna show you this one time, all right?
Instincts.
Show me your instincts.
Show me your instincts.
They're right here.
Own your instincts.
All you doing is using your instinct.
That's it.
That's how a tiger know he got to tackle a gazelle.
There's a code written in his DNA.
It says, "Tackle the gazelle." Okay.
And believe it or not, in every man, there's a code written that says: "Tackle drunk bitches." No.
You know what, I don't feel comfortable...
hitting on drunk "bitches," you know.
I don't think that's right.
Okay, hold up.
First of all, you making it out to be some kind of bad thing.
I didn't use bitches in a derogatory sense.
You did.
It just does...
This doesn't feel right.
Of course it don't feel right.
What has felt right for you didn't work.
You need to try some wrong, dawg.
Okay, how do I tell which ones are drunk?
Now you're talking.
All right, check this out.
You see this redhead over here?
Where?
With the big old titties.
I'm not gonna stare at a woman.
Dawg, I'm not telling you to stare at nobody.
I'm telling you to use your peripherals.
Now look at me.
See.
Look.
See?
Yeah.
I'm not looking at you.
No.
I'm looking at...
You're looking at her?
What do you want me to do?
I want you to use your peripherals.
See?
I'm not looking at you.
No.
See, I'm looking at the redhead at : with the big titties.
You see her, racked up right there, see her?
Yes.
Yeah.
You find one with the peripherals.
Okay.
You see, over by the post.
It looks like a...
It's either a ficus...
It might be a rubber tree plant.
All right, if you're making a joke, dawg, it's not funny.
I see a blonde and she's very pretty.
Better, okay.
All right.
Now with your peripherals...
Yeah.
...you got to scope out a hot, drunk chick.
And then you should make your move.
Okay?
All right.
Yes.
And remember, it's more important that she's drunk than she's hot.
For this first one.
Go get her.
Peripherals, though.
All the way.
All peripherals.
That boy is stubborn.
Hi, I'm Andy.
You look comfortable.
Can I get you another cocktail?
Too drunk.
But you got the right idea.
But clinically alive.
Hey!
Yo!
I'm having trouble finding the drunk people.
You want to know where there's one?
Yeah.
I.
I, Captain Yellowshirts.
Okay.
Have a good one.
Yo!
What?
I met a girl and she's here with a bachelorette party...
and they invited us to party with them.
Okay, that's good.
It's so good...
because no one is hornier than a girl...
who's about to watch her friend get married to a guy.
It's so funny.
So we just decided because this is my last night as a free woman...
before I marry Dan, that we would just wig out.
We're wigging out!
You guys are hilarious.
Wait a minute.
Yes, Mr President.
Yes, the erection results are in.
Hey, guys, look, it's Dr Zeus' penis.
I really mean this.
Hey, everybody, who wants penis cake?
I do.
She does.
Hey, you guys, Betty Cocker.
What a good guy.
What a...
Dan, the guy Robin's marrying...
is such a good guy.
He sounds like a good guy.
I hated him for like two years 'cause he cheated on me.
But...
he's really changed now.
He's a really good guy now.
Your friends seem nice.
You have really kind eyes, you know that?
Thanks.
Your hat has sequins.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Your hands are on my belt.
What?
Your hands are on my belt.
I'm sorry.
It's good.
You're cute.
This is kind of lame.
You wanna get out of here?
Okay, yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck.
Come on.
Okay.
You wanna drive?
I don't have a car with me here, so...
Cars just suck.
I'm driving.
Are you drunk?
No, I didn't have anything to drink.
Blow into this?
Okay.
What is this?
The judge recommended I get one.
[Get Ur Freak On playing on car stereo] Whoa, okay.
Wow.
That's fast.
Okay.
Come on, you're in the lasso.
Missy be puttin' it down I'm the hottest round I told y'all mother-uh Y'all can't stop me now Listen to me now I'm lastin' rounds And if you want me, people Then come on get me now And Dan's like, "You're such a B-l-T-C-H, bitch!" And I'm like, "You're the bitch, bitch." You know?
Yeah.
What was your name again?
Andy.
Andy.
Let me tell you something, Andy.
Don't ever be named Dan.
Dan rhymes with man, and men jerk off.
And he was a jerk-off.
Do you know what I mean?
Look out!
The car!
Wow.
I like you.
You're not a...
Ugh.
I think I ate some bad shellfish sandwich or something.
You're cute.
No.
That tasted good.
That tasted like shellfish.
Look out!
Sorry.
Watch it!
Do you think I'm pretty?
Oh, yes.
Oh, God, yes!
You're not looking at me.
Yes, you're pretty.
You're not looking at me.
Yes, you're pretty.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Look at me.
Look at me!
I'm looking!
You're pretty!
God, I just wanna live!
God, I hope I get my period soon.
I am in a bad mood.
Okay.
I'm so tired.
Hey, whoa!
Oh, God!
Turn away!
Hey, get off the wheel.
You're not gonna get in my pants acting like that.
I'm starving.
Let's get some fucking French toast.
Okay, here we are.
Oh, God, we made it.
Home sweet home.
Oh, mommy!
Are you okay?
The fucker came out of nowhere.
Okay.
We're okay.
Are you okay?
Well, are you...
What's the matter?
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
I think I kind of had that coming.
I'll still have sex with you if you want.
You know what, I think I'm gonna pass on the sex, if you don't mind.
At least I don't have to work out tomorrow.
Did you have a daiquiri tonight?
Yeah.
I thought you might.
It was a very bad night.
Yeah, laugh.
You know what, you guys wouldn't be laughing right now...
if some girl had just vomited shellfish sandwich into your mouth.
You know what, you're right, it's my bad.
Let me apologize to you first of all...
for not mentioning in detail that when you pick up a drunk woman...
who's falling down on her way out of the bar...
that you should probably drive.
I drive a bike.
Okay, Mr Schwinn-fucking-Armstrong, who asked you to drive a bike?
You know what, I'm not the only person in the world...
who rides a bike.
Yeah, everyone rides a bike, when they're fucking six.
Why don't you kiss something?
Because this is over, you guys, okay?
Can I just interject for a second?
Let me just say...
you're putting the pussy up on this pedestal.
You're just building the pussy up, man.
What are you even talking about?
"Building the pussy up," what does that mean?
You making the pussy into this great big Greek goddess named Pussalia...
and what you're doing is...
you're psyching yourself into thinking it's some impossible feat.
Yeah, I think you're right.
I'm putting the pussy up on a pedestal.
Right.
That's it.
It's "Pussalia," right?
Look where you going.
I don't wanna say the word anymore.
Say what word?
"Pussy." I don't wanna say it.
Fuck it.
"Pussy" is a scientific word.
Dude!
New pants, man.
You know what, Dave?
You know, you said there wasn't gonna be any pressure at all.
I'm not pressuring you.
Excuse me.
Can one of you guys help me, please?
No hablo English, lady.
I actually am helping a customer right now.
Okay, well...
I'm on break.
But our stock supervisor is very knowledgeable.
He can answer all of your questions and he'd love to help you.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
You, too.
Great, okay.
Hi, I'm Trish.
Hi, Andy is my name.
This one looks pretty good.
You don't wanna buy that VCR.
I don't?
No, actually to be totally honest with you...
you don't wanna buy any VCR.
It's a dead technology.
It's like getting an eight-track player.
Yeah.
Or a Betamax.
You know what, actually I'd recommend this one.
This is a dual.
You've got the VCR and DVD combo.
So, you know, that technology would be probably pretty good for...
Six months or so?
Yeah.
That's good.
At best.
Sorry.
No.
As good as it gets.
Okay, that sounds good, then.
Okay, all right.
It's perfect.
Sorry.
Coming through.
Okay.
God, you know, it's so funny, I work right across the street...
and I've never been in this place.
Really?
Where at?
Yeah.
The "We Sell Your Stuff On eBay" store.
Yes.
And that's the name?
Yeah, I was looking for something...
you know, obvious.
So I chose that.
I don't understand.
So, what, you do what?
Well, I take the stuff that you don't want...
and then I "sell" it on eBay.
But you don't actually sell anything in the store?
No.
I don't.
So why do you have a store?
I don't know.
No, I think it's because, you know, I wanna maybe look professional...
and not like a crazy person who's just gonna steal all your shit.
Sure.
I didn't mean anything by that.
No, it's okay.
You know what, you should come by sometime if you want, you know...
see it for yourself, check it out.
I'll check out your empty store.
Yeah, it's the one across the street that's not empty.
Here's my number.
So...
All right.
So, just anytime.
Why do I need your number if you're across the street, though?
I don't really have a good answer for that, Andy.
I just...
Sorry.
Just giving it to you.
So I'll write you up, and I'll meet you over at the register.
Okay.
And check you out...
Check out.
Okay, see you over there.
Okay.
Okay.
Awful chatty.
Hey...
Look, I think she gave me her number.
She wrote down her number, but I think she gave me her number.
No, she gave you.
Dude, man.
See, you still mad at me?
No, I was never.
Right, you see what I mean?
Yeah, we gonna celebrate it, man.
Yeah.
This is pretty cool.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
Come on, give him some credit, man.
The man pulled a number.
It's just...
I was in...
I can't believe that happened.
What you did with you's own hand.
Man, she just gave me her number.
That's great, man.
I'm telling you, love is a mysterious fig.
It is.
Okay, here's a question.
When should I call her?
You like her?
Yeah.
You definitely don't want to call her.
When is the next Olympics?
So what you just got to do is...
just get you a bunch of these hood rats...
run through them, just knock them out.
Boom, boom, boom.
And once you've done slayed like of them hood rats...
now you ready to go up to the upper echelon type ho.
You know what I mean?
I'm not a big ho runner.
My uncle used to drive a ho runner.
Screw these analogies.
What he's saying is...
you are going to be so bad at sex the first time...
you don't want to have sex with someone you like...
'cause they'll think you're a weirdo for being so lame at it.
You want to have sex with hood rats first...
so that by the time you get to the girl you do like...
you're not terrible at sex, you'll be mediocre at it.
Probably still pretty bad, though.
Let's put it up for my man for pulling that number.
Way to go, man.
Politicked his ass off.
You did politic.
Thanks a lot.
Like a train, round the bend.
You ready?
Yeah.
I can't.
Do it.
I can't pee in public.
Gotta do it.
I've got a mental block about it.
Come on, do it.
I'm shy!
I peed in public!
Let me out.
I can't hear what you're saying.
I don't want to be in here.
It's a soundproof room.
Just learn the techniques.
Right on, man.
You guys, this is not funny!
Hello.
Hey, what you watching?
Dawn of the Dead, man.
Great.
The store is slow.
Paula's gone.
Yo, is Paula back?
No.
She's not here.
She said we can't watch this in here.
You sure?
I know.
Can I ask you something in confidence?
I know this is gonna sound weird.
Am I good-looking?
Do you think a woman will find me attractive?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, the blood just...
Okay, never mind.
Wait, Andy.
Hold up.
Listen, this is embarrassing for me.
This is hard to talk about.
Are you ready for my honest answer?
Yes.
Yeah.
I think you're a good-looking cat.
I don't think that anybody knows it...
and I don't think anybody can see it.
Well, that's why I'm asking you.
You seem really well-groomed and really put together.
I mean, look, dude.
You think this was an accident?
All of this right here?
Premeditated, partner.
You gotta highlight your attributes, like a diamond in the rough.
You willing to make some sacrifices?
Absolutely.
You see that whole Teen Wolf thing you got going right there?
You need to wax that right out.
Does it hurt?
No.
Waxing don't hurt.
I mean, not unless you're a bitch.
You know what I mean?
It didn't hurt me.
I get it done all the time.
What the fuck!
Fuck that nigger up!
Bitch, get out of the room!
This is gonna be good.
This the one right here, right?
Hi, how are you?
So this is your first time getting body waxed?
Yes, it is.
Take off your shirt.
Okay.
We're gonna need more wax.
I'm staying.
This is gonna be good.
And clear all my appointments in the afternoon.
Here we go.
That feels warm.
I like your sweater.
Does that come in a V-neck?
She starts doing his pubes, I'm out of here.
You gonna look good after this, man.
Thanks, man.
So, ready?
Yeah.
You fucker!
I'm sorry.
That's just your job.
You want me to stop now?
No.
It's okay.
Let's do another one.
That one little patch looks sexy though.
Does it look good?
Yeah, it looks really good.
It looks man-tastic.
Okay.
Wow!
I didn't expect that at all.
I really didn't expect that.
You got it.
The first one is the only one that hurts.
Yeah.
Those hairs are pretty deep.
Okay.
You ready?
Yup.
Sucker motherfucker!
You shithead!
I hate you!
I hate you so much!
That one hurt.
That one hurt just as much as the first one.
That's great, man.
Man!
One, two, three.
Fuck me!
In the asshole!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I really don't swear this much.
You know what, I got a weak stomach.
That's all I can really take.
I'll see ya'll.
Jay.
Be tough, Andy, you got it.
Where did Jay go?
He went to throw up.
Ready?
Yup.
One, two.
Cocksucker motherfucker!
You pulled on two.
Why didn't you pull on three?
Freddy pie hole!
No!
Kelly Clarkson!
Ya'll done or ya'll...
That's fucked up.
Oh, shit falls!
That's fucked up.
I hate you.
Stop smiling, you jerk!
You pussy.
Oh, God.
What's next?
You're doing the nipple.
Not the nipple.
Come on.
Not the nipple.
Please, Cal, hold my hand.
You kidding me, man?
Hold my goddamn hand, man.
Do it!
Just hold.
Okay, here we go.
Ready?
No.
Yup.
One, two, three.
Nipple fuck!
Mika, you should burn in hell!
Okay, all right.
No, seriously, I think I'm done.
I think we're done.
I think that's good.
You know what, guys...
this is not a good look for me!
You look like a man-o'- lantern.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Andy, I owe you an apology, man.
I wasn't very nice to you for the past two-and-a-half years.
You were nice to me.
No, I was...
I thought you were really boring and...
I kind of thought you were a serial killer.
I'm not joking.
Hey!
Sorry.
Shoot.
Sorry, sorry.
Don't worry.
There's a lot of padding in these.
I could hurl it off the balcony, it would be fine.
Yeah.
It will be fine.
We couldn't break this...
if we tried.
No problem.
Look, you shouldn't listen to Dave and Jay, okay?
Those guys are crazy.
You should listen to me, okay?
Look, there is a hot-ass girl who works right there.
There she is, in the bookstore.
You should ask her out, man.
Something wrong with her underpants.
Yeah, they're not in my mouth.
You know, I kind of...
like the woman from the eBay store.
That's great, but...
you're not gonna get with anyone...
unless you play the odds on this, man.
You need to plant a lot of seeds.
It's like this.
When I was growing pot, I realized...
that the more seeds I planted...
Thank you.
...the more pot I could ultimately smoke.
I think I have all the advice that I can handle right now.
Don't get bitter.
I'm not bitter.
I almost lost a nipple, okay?
That was Jay's idea, okay?
And I wasn't going to say anything, but waxing your chest is...
like the gayest thing you could possibly do, okay?
Look at me.
Looks are not important.
Really look at me.
I am ugly as fuck by traditional standards...
but I get with women.
Aren't you curious as to how that's possible?
I am not ugly as fuck.
I didn't say you were ugly as...
Well, you implied it.
Okay.
It doesn't matter if you're ugly as fuck or you're ugly as shit.
It's about talking to women, and I know how to do that...
because I observe, because I am a novelist.
What?
You never told me that before.
That's because I am not an arrogant prick, Andy.
Okay?
The problem most men have is...
they don't know how to talk to women.
You know what my problem is?
I am not interesting.
What am I supposed to say?
"I went to magic camp?" "I'm an accomplished ventriloquist?" "I am a seventh-degree imperial yo-yo master." Do me, yo-yo master.
I want you to do me, 'cause you're the yo-yo guy.
Are you done?
Listen.
The problem most men have is...
they just plain straight up have no clue how to talk to women.
Just ask a question, okay?
That's it.
Because women do not care about what you have to say...
at all anyway, you know.
And all they want to do is talk about themselves.
So you're just gonna let them do that.
Okay?
So remember.
Questions, be cool, and be kind of a dick.
Here, be David Caruso in Jade.
Okay.
I know exactly what you're talking about.
You do.
That's good.
There she is.
Go plant that seed, man.
Plant it with your finger.
Can I help you?
I don't know.
Can you?
Are you looking for something?
Is there something I should be looking for?
We have a lot of books.
So, maybe it depends on what you like.
What do you like?
We have a great section of...
do-it-yourself.
Do you like to "do it yourself"?
Sometimes.
I mean...
if the mood strikes.
How is the mood striking you now?
What's your name?
What's your name?
I'm Beth.
Andy.
Andy.
Don't tell on me, okay, Andy?
I wont.
Unless you want to be told on...
Beth.
Wow.
That totally worked!
I literally said nothing.
And she found me fascinating.
I would've thought you were doing that for years.
Should I have asked her out?
No.
That's the key.
You wait for it to grow into a plant...
and then you fuck the plant.
Okay.
This is easy.
All right.
Hello, Trish.
How you doing?
What's going on?
Good joke.
This is a fun conversation.
Just grow a backbone and call her.
She asked you to call her.
She wants you to call her.
Hello.
Hey, how you doing?
How you doing?
I'm well.
Who is this?
This is James.
James.
Do I know you, James?
I was wondering whether you had a few minutes...
to talk about a little laundry detergent.
Are you a telemarketer, James?
Yep.
Are you at the top of a tall building?
Can you get to a roof quickly?
Jump off!
I mean, you people are sick.
Get a real fucking job, why don't you?
Go shoot yourself in the fucking head.
Hey, why don't you just, you know, get a knife and run into it?
Why don't you do that, huh?
Okay.
I'll see you later, James.
Nice to talk to you.
Fuck your mother, okay?
Bye-bye.
Oh.
Hey, man.
Got a big box of porn for you.
Can I come in?
Yeah.
Sweet video game chair.
So what's in the box?
It's my personal collection of erotica.
I want to give it to you.
I think there might be a few tapes in there that just might open up...
Pandora's box of love.
Okay.
Amy and I, we used to watch Harry Twatter...
and we'd put it on the television...
and then act it out as it was going on...
and it was...
She's adorable.
Fucking bitch.
Well, you know, this is really gracious and kind...
and generous and everything.
But I just don't want a big box of porn in my apartment.
There's some really great stuff in here.
Really great movies in here, man.
Hey, did you ever see School of Rock?
Yeah.
Well, this is...
It's called School of...
You know...
That's nice.
But it stars Jack Black Cock.
That makes sense.
Dude, here it is.
Boner Jams ' .
It's a mixed tape I made.
All these great scenes that I was really into in the summer of .
I think you'd really dig it.
Yeah.
Now I can see that.
This is...
Everybody Loves Raymond.
That's probably not supposed to be...
This is a good show.
I just tape it sometimes.
Well, I don't think you understand something, Dave.
I don't want this stuff, okay?
Because I don't do that, that much.
What, masturbate?
Yeah.
Dude, I've jacked it twice since I've been here.
Are you kidding me?
Why not?
It's not a hobby of mine.
Well, then, that's the only hobby you don't have.
No, seriously, I just don't feel comfortable talking about...
You need to.
You're wound up.
You're like one of these action figures...
all hermetically sealed in your box.
You gotta play with...
Don't!
Don't take it out!
I'm sorry.
You know what, it's just...
It loses its value if you take it out of its packaging.
I'm just saying, let it out.
Give it some air, man.
Play with it.
Take your porn with you.
I'm not taking it.
Take your box-o-porn.
It's my gift to you.
No.
I don't want it.
David, it's not...
Andy, for the last time...
I don't want your giant box of pornography.
No, no, no!
Come on, man.
So uncool.
Uncool?
Uncool is trying to give an honest man a big box of porn, Andy.
For the last time, I don't want to watch...
School of Cock with you.
It's nothing official.
Just a little token of my appreciation.
Hi, Andy.
I'm gonna talk dirty to you.
I want to have lots of sexy sex with you.
I want to touch your big, fat noodle...
'cause I want to have naughty intercourse with you.
I want you to put your penis on, I mean, in me, Andy.
I want to do lots of, lots of sexy...
hot things with you.
Shit.
This really isn't working, Andy.
I don't know what to say...
because I am you.
Okay.
New tape.
Nothing is ever good enough and it's always our fault.
Hey, you can't speak to your mother like that.
You do.
She's not my mother.
I heard Dave gave you the box of porn.
Yeah, he did.
You ever watch, like, Primetime Live...
when they take a black light into a hotel room...
and show you all the semen all over the bedspread?
Yeah.
You blind someone with that box.
Could see that thing from space.
This right here, you looking at the Bentley of big screen TVs.
I'm talking about, this is the Rolls-Royce of big screen...
Sometimes, I think these butterflies are in here.
I think he might be fooling us all, though.
Really?
I actually think he might be, like, some genius...
and this is like some big, like, hilarious...
Like he's bored at work and he just wanted to kick up some shit...
so he told us all he's a virgin.
You're seeing that a lot of stuff that's not there.
You're just projecting all over him.
He might be an idiot savant...
but he's not, like, clever enough to go that deep.
But he's got a great body.
Would you fuck him?
In a New York minute.
You would fuck him?
Absolutely.
Hey, Andy, what are you doing for lunch?
I don't know.
I have a turkey sandwich.
We're gonna go around the corner.
I think you should come with us.
There's this great place.
A lot of cute girls.
I don't know.
Okay.
We brought you a shirt.
This place is pretty fancy.
Something going on?
Hey, who's ready to have some fun?
Hey, guys...
No, don't ignore me.
I know what this is.
Within one hour, you'll each have dates.
Don't...
Please don't do this.
I saw this on Primetime Live.
All right, ninja master.
We've given you all the advice we have to give.
Now you gonna put it in action.
Advice?
You guys all gave me different advice.
He thinks you're a pothead.
I am.
Dude.
Hey, partner.
What are you whining about?
You asked for this shit.
No, I didn't.
Will you just quit whining like a bitch?
I'm not whining like a bitch.
You are whining like a bitch.
And you about to cram like years of pimpage into one day.
I don't want to cram pimpage.
And after that...
you on my level.
Come on.
Just ask questions.
This is a bad idea.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Are you fine?
Yeah.
You're fine then?
Are you fucking retarded?
What the hell's the matter with you?
Do you want me to be fucking retarded?
When I look into the eyes of the children and the parents...
and they are smiling and saying: "Thank you, Dr Montalban, you saved my child "...
it was worth it.
Amy...
what are you doing here?
David.
And you are Gina?
Gina.
Hey, what's up?
Nothing.
Look, I'm going to be real honest with you.
It's been a long time since I've been with a man.
Spent a lot of time with the ladies.
Looking to get back up on that pogo stick.
You know what I'm saying?
Excuse me.
Remember that time when we made love and you cried in my arms?
Please don't reminisce about the times we fucked, please.
It's so creepy.
Let's go to Paris.
I want to take you underneath the Eiffel Tower and make love to you.
Cut it out.
Cut what out?
This go to Paris!
We've been broken up for like two years, man.
I don't want to date you anymore.
You're a whore.
I am not a whore.
I just didn't like you.
This is so us.
Psycho talk.
What?
You're a good-looking man.
Thank you.
Very pretty.
Real soft, delicate features.
You're real feminine, you know, which is good for me...
because that would be a simple sort of transition.
You know what I'm saying?
Maybe throw a little rouge on you, tuck your sac back.
You game?
No.
You need to stop fucking around with my friend, okay?
Because you're giving him hope, and it's driving the man crazy.
I moved, I changed my e-mail address, my phone number.
He's practically stalking me.
Well, I didn't know all that.
So, I'm sorry.
I love Minnesota.
I grew up in a town outside of Minneapolis...
with a population of, like, people.
Really small.
Yeah, it's like the Land of a Thousand Lakes.
What about you?
You're used to, like, a really big city.
Really...
God, yes.
The town that I grew up in was really small.
I mean...
you know, it was just so safe.
There was no crime.
I mean, a girl could just walk from one end of town to the other...
and just, you know, feel completely safe.
You suppose he's had enough?
Spank bank has once again been filled.
I'll tell you who's the hottest.
You're gonna think I'm crazy.
Let me tell you.
Gina.
Can't get va-Gina out of my head.
Va-Gina all week.
You know what's a fun game?
Huh?
You take three Excedrin PMs..
and you see if you could whack off before you fall asleep.
You always win is the best part about the game.
Are you Andy?
Yeah.
Is this yours?
Did you write this stuff?
My girlfriend, Jill, found your speed-dating card.
Yeah, right.
God, I've been looking for that speed-dating card.
Thank you so much for bringing it to me.
So, you actually wrote that one girl looked like...
she was "hurting for a squirting"?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
Hurting for a squirting, I wrote that.
So you wrote "ho fo show." Yeah, I remember that girl.
She was a ho.
Fo show.
Let me show you how this device works.
Right, I'm just looking for a cordless phone.
Yup, it's great.
You can do anything, make video diaries...
Hey, Amy, how's it going?
How you feeling?
I'm great.
I feel fantastic since we broke up.
I feel awesome!
Can you just show me the department where there would be phones?
How have you been?
What's been going on...
I bet...
Hey, have you been doing a lot of this?
Sir, please, sir.
You are never gonna meet anybody...
with that kind of mentality about women, you sick son of a bitch.
Who the fuck are you to put me on trial?
I've never even met you.
So why don't you back the shit off, all right?
And stop with the inquisition.
That's how you talk?
You know what, I don't have to answer to you.
You ain't my bitch.
Know what I saying?
So, shit, man.
Fuck it.
You shouldn't even be hanging out with this pervert.
I don't hang out with him.
I work with him and that's it.
I tried to introduce him to a few nice people...
he made a fool of himself.
I don't mess with him, baby.
That's not me.
You should keep your ho on a leash.
Bro, I can't let you...
Hey.
I can't let you be talking to my woman like that, dawg.
Know what I'm saying?
Bitch is running wild, man.
You miss that ass?
That's the ass of a free man.
That ass is going out tonight, maybe to a club.
Maybe to a night club.
Hey, Andy...
take a look at your pal.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, he's performing a public colonoscopy.
Isn't that sweet?
I'm gonna send David home for the day...
and you're gonna fill in for him.
What?
Selling things?
You got that right.
I don't think that's a good idea.
And you're gonna have to talk to people, too.
I know that's a frightening concept to you...
but I think you can handle it.
So get out there and start selling some shit.
...thing for Amy.
Hold it.
Check it out.
I miss her.
Dude, the floor's the ultimate aphrodisiac.
All you got to do is go make your pick now.
Come on, man.
Okay.
And you could act a little enthused about it.
Yeah.
That's right.
That's right.
Gazelle in the pink top.
Oh, shit.
Hi.
Looks like you're checking out digital cameras.
You know what, he ain't going to do it willingly.
No.
We need to, like, really facilitate things a bit more.
Yo, Andy.
Yeah.
What's up, dude?
This is Jay, man.
Hey, Jay.
I am throwing a party tonight.
It's gonna be real mellow, just chilled up.
Now, you really need to be there.
It's gonna be really, really colorful.
Are you free?
Yeah, I think so.
That was a joke, man.
I know you're free.
I'm okay.
Gotta go, man.
All right, bye.
So, tell me, Montel...
why weren't we invited to the party?
What are we, Al-Qaeda?
No, hold up.
No, no.
It's not that kind of party, y'all.
You're not coming to our fucking party either, okay?
Fuck you, okay?
First of all, it ain't that kind of party.
Go fuck a goat.
Yeah.
Why you always telling me to fuck a goat, man?
Fuck a goat!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Are you here for Jay's party?
Yes.
I am Jay's party.
You know what, hiring a transvestite prostitute isn't helping me, man.
What?
Ain't nobody hired no damn transvestite.
What are you talking about?
She was really nice, incidentally.
If that sister was a transvestite...
that was the Mona Lisa of transvestites.
You got a hummer from the tranny, didn't you?
You know, aren't we owed one now?
'Cause technically we paid her.
Get a dick, man.
Do you guys even like me?
Or is this some sort of cruel joke that you're all in on?
Because I'm not a freak.
I'm a good person.
I always thought that Matt Damon was like a Streisand, but...
I think that he's rocking the shit in this one.
Shut up, Dave!
Hold up.
Let's just chill on the aggression for a minute.
Look at him.
He is such a bad ass.
He looks just like Luke Wilson.
Mmm-hmm.
So you saying she was definitely a man?
Yes.
Okay, well, how do you know that she was a man?
Because her hands were as big as André the Giant's.
And she had an Adam's apple as big as her balls.
So you have no proof.
You know what?
Just leave me alone.
Just stay away from me.
Or I'm gonna tell Paula...
that you're all stealing the recordable CDs.
Come on.
That's like we were paid to do it.
We did this 'cause we're your friends...
and we didn't think you have the balls to do it yourself.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay, watch this.
Yo, Andy, it's just CDs, man.
That's a third strike for me, dawg.
Hi.
Andy.
Hi.
Right, yeah.
You remember my name.
I did.
How you doing?
I'm great.
I like your store.
That's good, yeah.
If you have time, look around.
It's...
Okay.
How's business been?
You know, it's coming along.
I mean, it takes a while.
Do you want to go out sometime?
Yes.
Yes, I would like that.
That would be great.
I think I'm maybe free this weekend, if that's okay.
Or you could call me tomorrow and we can just firm it up.
Okay.
Great.
Great.
Okay, so I'll call you, and yeah, that'll be good.
How you doing?
Congratulations.
Okay, so I'll...
Yeah.
Can I help you?
Yeah, these are wonderful.
I'll take these.
Thanks, they are.
They're great.
The goldfish just crack me up.
Funny.
Yeah, they are.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They're cute.
I don't actually sell anything here.
I just sell them on eBay.
I don't get it.
Okay.
Can you help me?
No, you're on your own here.
Good luck to you, and to you.
And I'll give you a call.
Great.
Nice to see you.
Great.
Thanks for coming in.
Bye.
So, I guess I'll just give you some money...
and you can give me these shoes and...
You know, I know it seems so strange...
Yes.
I'd just rather buy them from you straight up.
Yeah, I know.
I wish it could be that easy, but...
I wish, too, but you're making it extremely difficult for me.
I'm just trying to get these shoes back to my house...
so I can wear them.
I got a corpse in my way.
Look out.
Just kill it.
That's just so not fair that you have blades and...
I'm telling you, man, I feel great.
I'm so...
It's like a weight has been lifted.
Celibacy is the way to go, man.
Andy had it right, you know?
Look at him.
He looks younger than all of us...
but he's years older.
Why?
Because he's never had a relationship.
No she-devil sucked his life force out yet.
Hello?
Hey.
Hi.
Hello.
Is this Trish?
Who's calling, please?
This is Andy.
Hi, Andy.
Hi, how you doing?
I'm good.
How're you doing?
I'm doing great.
So you're gay, now?
No, I'm not gay.
I'm just celibate.
I think...
I mean, that sounds gay.
I just want you to know that this is the first conversation...
of three conversations that leads to you being gay.
There's this and then in a year it's like, "You know...
"I'm kind of going to wanna get back out there, but I think I like guys." And then there's the big, "I'm a gay guy now." You're gay for saying that.
I'm gay for saying that?
You know how I know you're gay?
How?
How do you know I'm gay?
'Cause you macraméd yourself a pair of jean shorts.
You know how I know you're gay?
You just told me you're not sleeping with women anymore.
You know how I know you're gay?
How?
'Cause you're gay and you can tell who other gay people are?
Do you know how I know you're gay?
How?
You like Coldplay.
You're dead.
Come on.
Leave my torso alone at least.
I also wanted to call...
and see what night you might want to go out.
I'm actually free tonight.
Okay.
Now, I was thinking maybe this weekend, but that's good.
Okay.
Great.
Okay, what time do you want to pick me up?
Let's see.
That's actually kind of a problem because I ride a bike.
That's cool.
Are you kidding me?
I love getting on the back of a motorcycle.
My boyfriend in college drove a motorcycle.
So, I mean, I'm cool.
Yeah, I bet that was cool.
I ride a bicycle.
You know how I know that you're gay?
How?
You like the movie Maid in Manhattan.
You know how I know you're gay?
How?
I saw you make a spinach dip in a loaf of sourdough bread once.
You know how I know you're gay?
How?
You have a rainbow bumper sticker on your car that says: "I love it when balls are in my face." That's gay?
God damn it!
I'm ripping your head off right now.
It's off.
And now I'm throwing it at your body.
Fuck you!
You guys...
she's picking me up in an hour.
Oh, drag, dude.
She's picking you up from here?
Yeah.
That's fucked up, man.
Why?
Why?
Seriously.
I mean, look at this place, man.
You gotta see this through the eyes of a woman, you know?
What is she going to think when she comes in here?
Look.
He's got a billion toys.
So what?
And more video games than a teenaged Asian kid.
It's all right.
Is that the Six Million Dollar Man's boss?
It's Oscar Goldman.
Why do you have that?
That's worth a lot of money.
That's much more valuable than Steve Austin.
Well, that may be the case.
But none of this shit is sexy, okay?
I'm not trying to be sexy, man.
I mean, seriously, Asia?
You framed an Asia poster?
How hard did the people at the frame store laugh...
when you brought this in?
They did not laugh at me.
Know why you're gay?
Because you like Asia.
You guys cool it with the gay.
You know, she's on her way over here, okay?
First, you relax, okay?
Just stop calming me down and tell me what I should do.
Okay, we just take everything that's embarrassing...
and we move it out of here.
So it doesn't look like you live in Neverland Ranch.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
Good.
So, you wanna head out?
Did you just move in or something?
No.
Actually I'm getting new carpet in.
I'm having carpet put in tomorrow, so...
Well, you know.
Yeah.
Okay.
Looks good with the floors.
Yeah.
All right.
I should tear up the hard wood...
and see if there's carpet underneath.
That's never the case.
This is gonna be fun.
Yes.
You know, I drive by this place every day.
I've never been in before.
I'm glad you came.
You know, I never really go out with nice guys like you.
I think I've avoided nice guys like you my whole life...
at my own peril.
My last boyfriend drank a lot.
Mmm-hmm.
And so...
This is just punch.
No, it's okay.
A little bit's fine.
Buddha punch.
I need some Buddha.
Excuse me, miss.
Could you gather your team...
and sing happy birthday for my daughter, please?
That was so good.
What?
That was great.
Happy birthday.
It's your birthday, too?
No.
It's his birthday, too.
No, no, no.
Could you sing for him and bring him a cake?
Happy birthday.
Thanks a lot.
Happy birthday, Andy.
You really like kissing, don't you?
Yes.
I really do.
Take off your pants, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Wow, this is really gonna happen.
Oh, yeah.
Thank God.
Okay, I'm taking off my pants.
Yeah.
Do you need some help?
I think I almost got them.
It's hooked on my ankle.
Wow, that's...
Hey, wait.
Do you have protection?
I don't like guns.
That's funny.
I have condoms right here.
Okay?
Okay.
There's, you know...
Check the expiration date because they were from when I was married.
And we didn't have sex that often.
That's why there are so many, okay?
Okay.
I got them.
How does this go?
Okay .
" Roll over the tip and down onto the base." Over the balls?
It doesn't say.
Do you mind if I use your magnum?
Yeah.
Wow.
You got to be kidding.
I am Aquaman.
What is that?
Mom?
What's going on here?
Who the hell are you?
It's Andy.
Hi, I'm Andy.
God!
What are you doing?
Marla, get the fuck out of my room!
You know what...
I cannot believe that you're allowed to have sex when I'm not!
That is so unfair.
I'm gonna head out.
You should go.
Oh, Jesus!
How many times did you just do it?
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.
Dude, teach me.
Hotline.
Hi, yes, I'm calling because it's more than four hours...
and your ad said to call if it's been more than four hours.
How much of the medicine have you taken, sir?
I haven't taken any, but your ad said...
that if you've had an erection for more than four hours, you call.
You're only supposed to call if you've taken the medicine.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I must not have heard that part.
Yes.
If you haven't taken the medicine, you don't call.
Right.
I'm sorry.
Right.
So, there's nothing you can do?
I just don't wanna...
There's nothing I can do.
I'm in Bombay, India.
Okay.
No, not you personally.
I just don't want...
I just don't want to have an erection anymore.
You know, you could have sex.
Okay.
Yup.
That's one thing people do when they have an erection.
Yeah, that's not an option.
I don't have sex.
Okay, well, then you can masturbate.
I'd rather not masturbate.
If you'd like the erection to go away, you can light a match...
blow out the flame and put the hot ember on your wrist.
And that will focus the brain elsewhere...
and you will lose your erection.
Really?
That'd work?
Take your finger and flick your testicle...
and if you do that till it hurts...
your erection will go away.
Okay, all right.
It sounds unpleasant and it is.
It is a trick we use in India.
Okay, those are all good pieces of advice.
I really appreciate it.
We appreciate your business.
Oh, no.
We didn't get your business...
No, not this time.
I guess I didn't need you this time.
Thank you.
My goodness, Andy, you are a terrific salesman.
Thank you.
Gosh, you really got it down.
Thanks.
And your numbers are good.
Thanks.
I'm going to put you out on the floor full time.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.
Okay.
Good.
We're gonna get you a blue shirt and tie, all right?
Great.
Thanks.
You know, Andy, I've been thinking about your problem.
I think I might have a solution for you.
You ever heard of the term "fuck buddy"?
What?
It's a special friend...
who you fuck.
No, haven't heard that term.
When I was a little girl, I developed early.
By the time I was I had this body you're looking at.
Can you imagine that?
I don't want to, no.
Well, needless to say, a lot of male attention.
Like men, yes.
Especially from our Guatemalan gardener, Javier.
Okay.
You know, Javier...
before he made passionate yet gentle love to me for the first time...
he serenaded me with a beautiful old Guatemalan love song.
Really, that's...
That sounds nice.
Okay.
My goodness.
I think we better get back to work.
Yeah.
Yeah, I better go back to work.
Yeah.
So, okay.
All right.
So, you mull it over and I'll talk to you soon.
All right, I will.
Thank you.
Okay.
What's up, dawg?
What happened?
How was the date with Trish?
It was a disaster.
Really?
Yes.
I've never been more embarrassed in my life.
Couldn't get the condoms to work.
And one of them exploded on my balls.
And then her kid walked in the room.
Wait.
Hold up.
She was hiding the kid from you, dawg?
You know what, it doesn't matter...
because it was going downhill straight from there.
Listen, you don't want no baby-daddy drama.
Trust me on this one, all right?
For all you know, he in prison right now.
Let's say y'all living together.
Next thing you know, you the one going on the st and the th...
to pick up the government check.
What if he got boys that's on the outside...
and they stalking you?
You see what I'm saying?
You got to think, partner...
What the fuck are you talking about?
Here's what you do.
You tell her you're a virgin.
You test her with this shit, okay?
Here, tell me.
Tell me.
This is how it's gonna go.
Tell me.
I'm a virgin.
Sweet.
I like that because you don't have chlamydia.
And I know that, and that shit is everywhere.
What if she laughs at me, though?
Then you punch her in the fucking head if she laughs.
I'm not going to punch her in the head.
She's really sweet.
No.
I mean, you punch her in her fucking head emotionally.
She's different.
She's someone I felt like I had...
a connection with.
All you trying to do right now is bust off this first night.
You got a whole lot of semen back up in you.
I am going to tell her.
You should totally tell her, man.
I'm going to.
'Cause I watched this movie called Liar Liar...
and the message was, "Don't lie." And that was a smart movie.
Yeah, that's the right thing.
Yeah.
Really?
All your girlfriends wanted to have sex with virgins, too?
That's funny.
I didn't even know you girls talked like that.
I think my first time might be your best time, too.
Well, I knew it.
You know what...
I knew that you'd react that way and I knew that...
you would want to lead me through my first sexual encounter...
with all the compassion and care that someone...
would give to their soul mate.
Oh, my God.
I'm in trouble.
Hey, Andy.
You watching Survivor tonight?
No, actually I'm going out to dinner with somebody.
Hi.
This is her.
Trish, this is Joe and Sara.
Hi.
Hi, Trish.
Hey.
But tape it for me, okay?
Will do.
All right.
Thanks.
So long.
Bye-bye.
See you later.
Have a good night.
Yeah, my man's gonna get it on tonight.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, and you better get on me, too.
What is wrong with this woman?
Mercy, mercy, mercy.
I'm so sorry that happened the other night.
No, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
That was me.
No.
Let me...
I have something I want to tell you.
Kind of hard to talk about.
But...
you know, there are certain things...
about who I am that...
I'm sorry.
I just have to get this off my chest.
I am so sorry, I didn't tell you I had kids.
Yeah, what was that about?
Gosh.
You know, that really surprised me.
No, you should have told me probably, but...
I'm sorry.
I know.
What do I care if you have a kid?
Well, I have two kids.
Wow.
Okay.
How old are they?
Six.
Sixteen.
Twenty-one.
Forty-two.
Fifty-six.
How many kids do you have?
I have three.
Okay, three.
Yeah, and one of them has a kid.
A one-year-old.
That's cool.
That's great.
I'm really glad we're doing this.
Me, too.
Listen, Andy...
I don't want to send you running for the hills or anything, but...
I really feel like if we decide to do this again, then...
maybe we should hold off on the physical part for a while.
That is a fantastic idea.
Why didn't I think of that?
Really?
Totally.
No sex?
No.
Why do that?
Because here's the thing.
From personal experience...
I found that sex can really complicate things.
And what we should be doing right now is getting to know each other.
Yeah.
Well, I never thought you'd go for it.
I'm going for it.
Well, that just is a great, great notion.
Are you serious?
Look at my face.
Look at how serious I am.
Can you see my nostrils?
Yes.
That's serious.
That's more angry.
Yeah, you know what, most guys would be saying: "Yeah," right now, but, like, by the third date, it would be: "Hey, baby, I really need to physically express how I feel "...
and all that stuff.
Well, hey, baby...
you know, three dates...
Make it dates.
How about ?
Fifteen.
Screw your .
dates.
Okay, dates.
Twenty dates.
Okay.
This is genius.
It's gonna hurt.
Not as much as you think.
We can really get to know each other this way.
Yeah.
This is one, right?
No, next one.
Is it safe to come in, or are you guys doing it?
Honey, it's safe.
Great.
Well, good timing.
Yeah.
You remember Marla.
Hi, we met.
And this is my little bunny rabbit.
Julia.
Hey.
This is Andy.
Julia, how you doing?
You know what, do you by any chance like magic?
Yeah.
I thought that you might.
Because I noticed on the way in...
that you had something shiny behind your ear.
Marla, did you see that?
Something behind her ear?
You think you do?
Could I check?
Do you mind if I check behind your ear?
Big money!
That's amazing.
Wow, it is amazing.
There's something else, too, behind your ear, I think.
No, actually it's not behind your ear.
I think it is your ear.
Rip!
It is your ear.
There is your ear.
I ripped it off.
Gross!
Yeah, that's...
All right.
Wait.
Okay, but that means that you...
walk around with a rubber ear in your pocket all day?
Yeah, like half the time.
You know, I can come to your high school...
and do it for your friends if you want.
You know what, I should head out.
Really?
Yeah.
I have to give you a ride home.
Right.
Yes, you do.
Yeah, 'cause you don't have a car or anything, right?
Right, I don't have a car.
'Cause he doesn't have a car, and he does magic.
Awesome.
And sarcasm is like a second language to me.
So, I'm right there with you.
But, Dad...
I don't know how to love.
You never...
taught me how...
Hello.
Hey, Cal.
Hey.
I just got back from a date.
Did you tell her you're a virgin?
No.
I haven't gotten to that yet.
Really?
Are you having sex right now?
No.
She was incredible.
She was amazing.
She didn't pressure me.
And she has three kids.
And one of her kids has a kid.
You all right?
Did you just say she has three kids, one of whom has a kid?
Yeah.
So, so, she's a grandma?
No.
I'm not a doctor or anything like that...
but she's a fucking grandma.
Yeah, whatever, you know.
She's the hottest grandma I ever saw.
Yeah, she is.
She's a hot grandma.
That's a good-looking grandma.
My grandma looks like Jack Palance.
Well, she's no Jack Palance.
No.
If Jack Palance looked like that lady...
I would want to fuck Jack Palance right now.
Yeah, me, too.
She's a hot grandma.
Heck, yeah.
No, do a grandma, man.
You should fuck her on her plastic-covered couch.
Fuck her while she watches Murder, She Wrote.
She would probably find that very erotic.
Yeah, whatever, you know.
Fuck her and then have her send you a check for $ on your birthday.
I'm the dude with the hot granny.
What did you want to talk to me about?
Well, Andy, the numbers just came in...
and you are by far our best salesman.
So, I am promoting you to floor manager.
This is the bullshit of all bullshits!
You scumbag!
Ass kisser!
Thank you.
That's great.
I understand you have a girlfriend.
Yeah, kind of seeing somebody.
I'm very happy for you.
Thanks.
She's great.
Are you still a virgin?
You know, I don't really...
talk about my personal life.
You're a virgin.
Yes, I am.
Yeah.
My door is always open.
So to speak.
Great.
Great.
Thank you.
I'm very discreet.
But I'll haunt your dreams.
Okay.
Okay.
Wow.
So who's gonna take my job?
Cal will be taking over your job.
And he's interviewing people right now...
for his old job.
So, have you ever worked with electronics before?
No.
No?
But I have electronics in my home.
Perfect.
That's the job pretty much.
You're very well-qualified.
More than these other losers.
I could do that...
Wait, last thing.
I'm also gonna need that extended warranty on it...
for the price of "on the house." That I can't do.
Hey, don't be a Negro.
Be my nigger.
All right?
Help me out.
Hold up.
I ain't nobody's nigger.
I mean, you're somebody's nigger wearing this nigger tie.
Now you being condescending.
See, you've been warned, all right?
Just move forward amicably.
Okay.
Well, check this out.
First of all, you're throwing too many big words at me.
Okay, now because I don't understand them...
I'm gonna take them as disrespect.
Watch your mouth, and help me with the sale.
Okay, see, now you found yourself a nigger.
You were looking for a nigger?
Nigger here now.
See?
Today's forecast: Dark and cloudy, and chance of drive-by.
You want to go?
I suggest you move back.
Then, nig, fire on.
What are we gonna do?
What are you gonna do, Mr Floor Manager?
Go, get them, tiger.
This shit just got rigged.
What are you gonna do, bitch?
I'll tell you what.
You know Luca Perry from th and th?
You ever heard of, Rolling s, nigger?
Since I was nigger, I'm saying "frosty." You know what I'm saying, "spoon", nigger.
We fucked dwarfs in the ass.
Nigger, this dwarf here don't got to be tall...
to pull the trigger off in somebody face!
Come on nigger, back up.
What's up?
Hey...
Welcome to Smart Tech.
Is this your boy?
What can I help you with?
Yeah, nigger, we will both mash you!
How can we help you, sir?
Nigger, what?
No, he don't need no help.
He's already been served.
I served him.
He's taken care of.
He's a little slow, but he got it.
See, what he thought was he can come up in here and make the rules.
But now he see that Jay make the moves at Smart Tech...
that I run this, bitch and now he bought the bounce.
This your boy?
Yeah, that's my boy.
We represent Smart Tech.
You just got fucked up with him.
Both y'all niggers going get clapped up when I get back.
Both of you all niggers.
What did I do?
It don't fucking matter!
Yeah, aim high, Willis.
Aim high!
Please don't do this.
Jay, what's going on?
Jill broke up with me.
I'm so sorry.
What happened?
I came home a little tipsy.
And I had one of my condoms on still.
Woke up the next morning and jumped in the shower with her.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Why did you cheat on her?
Because I'm insecure!
You can't tell?
I know, man.
It's gonna be okay.
I'm cold.
It's gonna be all right, man.
Seriously, man, I'm sorry.
I apologize to you.
I know.
If you wanna have a meaningful relationship...
you've got to leave the sex out of it, man.
You're right.
It's all right.
You're good.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
I love you, man.
Man, I love you, too.
You're a good guy.
Do you know how I know you guys are gay?
You're holding each other ever so gently.
Cabrón.
Bravo.
At least he can cook, Mom.
[Believe It Or Not (The Greatest American Hero theme) playing] I love...
Spiderman.
Pull out slowly and go straight ahead.
I'm all right.
Nobody's there.
I want to know everything about you.
I want to tell you.
You do?
Yeah.
Like, what do you want to do?
What are your dreams?
You don't wanna work at Smart Tech for the rest of your life.
I've been working there for a long time.
And I've been thinking lately that maybe I should open my own store.
Really?
Yeah.
What kind of store?
Well, like a stereo store.
Oh, my God, that is...
Why don't you do that?
I don't have enough money to do that.
What about those collectibles?
I bet if you sold those, you could make a lot of money.
I just sold a guy's G.
I.
Joe for $ .
Really?
Do you have any of those?
Yeah.
You do?
I have of them.
No, you don't.
Yeah, in their original boxes.
You do?
I could help you sell them on eBay.
I would not take a commission, I swear to God.
You could do it.
You could totally pull it off.
Yeah, let's do it.
Let's do it.
Aquaman.
Here.
Clothes on.
I'll send you off to...
a farm with lots of land.
So, you and other Aquamen can run around...
and play in the Aquafields.
Godspeed, Col.
Steve Austin.
You don't wanna go, do you?
Okay, you can stay.
Steve Austin can stay.
Hey, Cal.
David.
Way to sell a big TV.
She likes you, man.
Too bad I retired my penis.
Mooj, we try to be fair with the schedule but it's hard.
Okay, but why every damn schedule comes up, I get most early shift?
It's bullshit.
Nobody buys stereo at : in the morning.
No, I understand.
People buy stereo between : and : .
Mmm-hmm.
Rich men get off work, then buy stereo.
Right.
Not after fucking brunch.
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.
I'm going to give you a couple of Jay's shifts.
And then I'll give you a couple of mine and that way...
we'll all be equal, okay.
Thank you, Andy.
It's okay.
You're a good man, Andy.
By the way, what date are you on, now?
I think it's around .
It's hard to tell what actually constitutes a date, though.
Three to go.
So that means you're gonna have sex in three days.
Maybe, I might try to space them out a little bit.
I'll pray for your cock.
Okay, thanks.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Have a good cocky.
Trish is on the phone.
Here is a shock.
Girlfriend with a problem.
Hello.
I have done everything but sex!
I'm a woman, okay?
Deal with it!
I'm gonna start taking you back to church.
We are gonna start going to church.
Hello?
You know what?
What the hell are you talking about?
Oh, my God, I cannot believe this.
Thank God you're here.
Jesus Christ.
Marla locked herself in the bathroom.
What happened?
She wants to go to the family health clinic.
She wants birth control.
But she's too young.
I want to have sex with my boyfriend!
But I can't, Mom!
So, you want me to take her?
No, I don't want you to take her.
Okay, all right.
I want her to keep it in her pants until she gets to college.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
"Keep it in my pants"?
Okay, you didn't keep it in your pants, Mom.
I know.
I don't want you to make the same mistakes as me, Marla.
Mistakes?
Okay, so I was a mistake then.
No, you're not a mistake.
Your sister was the mistake.
Oh, my God!
Her older sister, I mean, she wasn't planned, you know what I mean?
Because I was such a...
Oh, God, you wanna run away, don't you?
No.
You and your boyfriend have sex all the time!
Oh, my God!
Are you kidding?
We never have sex.
Do we ever have sex?
No, we don't.
What?
Yes, you do!
You're such a liar!
Why do you lie to me?
Why?
I didn't hear anything after "a liar." What did she say after "a liar"?
She sounds like a tea kettle.
Fuck you!
Maybe I should take her.
No, I don't think so.
You know, a little information never hurt anybody.
Cool.
Wow!
Where do you put the penis?
Oh, shit.
It is...
not a Rubik's Cube.
Shit.
God, how much longer are they gonna make us wait?
I don't know.
They should be out in a second.
Now, you're all here...
because you're interested in obtaining birth control.
Any questions?
Here's a cute story.
I came home the other day...
and he is with his girlfriend in my marital bed...
doing things that are illegal in Alabama.
Sex acts, right?
Things that my wife won't do, okay?
Did you have a question?
How do I get my wife to do that?
Does anybody else have a question?
My daughter is, for lack of a better word...
dumb.
How do I stop her menstrual cycle?
You want her to stop having a menstrual cycle?
I want to stop it, maybe just for a few years.
Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.
Does anybody else have a question?
I have a question.
I think some of the people here might be sexually inexperienced.
Is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?
Is that a serious question?
No.
It wasn't.
Okay.
Now, there are a lot of activities that you can engage in...
without having sex that are both fun and safe.
What sort of activities?
I think...
everybody wants to know about the activities.
Well, instead of having intercourse, you could have outer-course.
Outer-course?
What's that?
Yeah, what is that?
Outer-course is anything that isn't vaginal intercourse.
I prefer vaginal intercourse.
He really does.
Now, there are ways of having sex without intercourse.
Let's see, there are things like body rubbing or dry humping.
You could dry hump.
There is masturbation.
Masturbation.
Play with yourself.
Mutual masturbation.
Play with a friend.
Deep kissing.
There is erotic massage.
That sounds like it would be nice.
Oral sex play.
Sounds like my Friday night.
Shut up, Seth.
We went to temple.
Okay, are there any virgins here...
who are thinking about having sex for the first time?
Oh.
Wait.
So you're a virgin?
I'd tap that.
Oh, yeah, you'd "tap that"?
Seth, what, you think you're cool with your little Jew fro?
We don't say, "tap that." What are you talking about, Seth?
You know what, I'm a virgin, too.
That's...
We're virgins, too.
Yeah.
No, you know what, it's a personal choice...
and I don't think it's weird at all.
You know what your problem is?
You're putting the pussy on a pedestal.
That's the second time I've heard that.
What is the "pussy on a pedestal" thing?
Okay, I can't listen to anymore of this, 'cause it's making me sick.
So, bye.
You can get this information on your website, right?
Yes.
Thanks.
Nice meeting everybody.
Any other questions?
Do you have any extra-large condoms?
Seth, you got a tiny penis.
So, I made that all up to help you out.
No, you didn't.
But thank you for doing that.
How can you tell?
Well, you know, I go to school with, like, guys...
who are all trying to have sex.
And, yeah, so I can tell who's done it.
Of course.
And you really haven't?
No, I really haven't.
Please don't tell your mom, okay?
Yeah, I won't.
Thanks.
But when are you gonna tell her?
Believe me, I'm working on it.
I am working on it.
Do you have any weed?
Yeah.
You do have some.
Can spare any or is it all spoken for?
I mean, like what are we talking?
Are we...
Just enough to get me baked for like a week.
That's a lot of weed.
Yeah, I am taking vacation next week, so...
Where are you going?
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll stay in my apartment.
Just getting baked?
I want to be baked the whole time.
Watch TV, I'll probably re-watch Gandhi.
Gandhi baked is good.
Yes, isn't it?
I always feel bad when I watch it baked...
'cause I get really hungry and I'm eating a lot...
and poor Gandhi is...
fucking starving his ass off.
Starving, I know.
Sounds good.
Yeah.
I'm going to take her to capacity.
Are you okay with that?
Give it a shot.
Freak!
Oh, yeah!
Michael McDonald, man, I haven't heard this in years.
Yeah, I haven't heard it in like minutes.
If I get the set, will you throw in the DVD?
You don't get the set.
I'll throw in the DVD.
I'll take it.
Really?
Yeah.
Y'all want to see something beautiful?
Come here.
You want to see the most beautiful thing in the world?
Check this out.
This is my baby right here.
That's my baby's dick right there.
Looks like a poltergeist.
That is his foot.
Look at his dick.
That's not even four months.
Extrapolate that.
By the time he's what's gonna happen?
Yo, Andy!
Come check this out, dawg.
Is this the movie about babies that are geniuses?
No, this is my child, dude.
Jill is pregnant.
That's yours?
Yeah.
That's why she broke up with me in the first place...
'cause she just thought that I wouldn't be a good father...
in light of the fact that I'd be cheating on her all the time.
But she got over all that.
It's cool now.
Congratulations, man.
That is great.
We having a party tonight, Andy...
and I really want you to be there, man.
We celebrating and I really, really want you to be there.
It looks like the Doppler radar.
Can you believe that?
This child ain't even four months old.
He ain't four months old yet.
Look at what he's packing.
Everybody dick looks big on -inch TV.
My sister's dick looks big on TV, okay?
Oh, my God, this guy, Eric Gilliland...
he has bought, like, of these.
Really?
Yeah, I think he likes action figures even more than you.
That is impossible.
I think so.
Andy, the way these things are flying off your shelf...
you know, I think you could actually make like...
maybe like $ .
Really?
Yeah, you could open your store.
Wow.
Honey...
That's a lot of money.
I know.
That's incredible.
I wouldn't have done it without you.
Thanks.
And that's not the only good news.
What?
You know what tonight is?
Survivor is on?
No.
I know.
Is it The Apprentice?
No.
What?
It's our th date.
Wow.
Yeah.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Seriously?
I think we're at .
'Cause there were a couple of dates there...
that don't really count as dates.
No.
I'll give you a free pass on those other ones.
Thank you.
Listen.
What?
Listen.
Mmm-hmm.
I really like you.
I think I'm falling for you.
I don't know.
I kind of see this going somewhere.
I do, too.
I just think we should just go crazy on each other.
Okay.
Okay?
Oh, thank God!
Oh!
Okay, I should...
I gotta pick those up.
Don't pick them up now.
No, I have to pick those up right now.
Wait, we'll get them later.
Listen, no, I can't, no.
Listen, it's really important because...
once the integrity of the box gets compromised...
This is original packaging and that's why these things...
are so valuable.
So you don't screw with that.
You really don't screw with that.
All right.
We can wrap them again later, you know.
Yeah, I know.
But you know what...
this is very important that we don't lose the value...
and compromise the integrity of it.
Andy, I'm throwing myself at you and...
all you can think about is a fucking toy.
They're not fucking toys!
This is Iron Man, okay?
I got this when I was in second grade.
Do you know how hard it is for a kid to not open that?
This is important.
These are my things...
and you are trying to make me sell them and I don't want to.
No.
And you're making me.
I'm not making...
You are encouraging me...
to quit my job.
I'm not!
I'm not trying to...
You want me to open a store.
You want me to sell everything.
You know what, I'm gonna tell you something.
I don't just change like that.
I can't just change for you.
I don't...
I'm not trying to change you.
I like you.
I'm just...
I'm trying to help you grow up, Andy.
Well, thanks a lot.
I mean, my God, you ride a bicycle to work in a stockroom.
You know what, I'm not in the stockroom anymore.
I'm a floor manager.
Okay.
And I ride a bike because I like to.
Einstein rode a bike.
He had a wife who he fucked, by the way.
What do I have to do for you to have sex with me?
Do you want me to dress up like Thor?
I'll dress up like Thor.
I'll dress up like Iron Man.
What do they do?
I'll do it.
What?
Everything's always about sex.
Why don't you want to have sex with me?
Why not?
Tell me.
You tell me the truth.
Is it because I have a kid who has a kid?
Is that why?
No, it's cool that you're a grandmother.
I love the fact that you're a grandmother.
Oh, God!
You are.
You're a hot grandma.
Oh, my God!
You are so mean!
Get out!
Okay, fine.
Good!
Good, fine.
You're gonna go.
I didn't ask for any of this.
You asked for all of it, Andy.
Okay.
Great.
Okay.
That's the way you want it...
that's the way homie's gonna play it.
Yeah.
Truth be told.
Baby, you better enjoy yourself tonight...
'cause once this baby's born, you ain't going out again...
till that baby is in college.
Me?
Yeah.
You the club rat.
I'm not the one that be going out.
I'm not a club rat.
You're gonna get up, you march over there...
and I want you to hit on Bernadette now.
Dude, I'm not gonna hit on Bernadette.
Yes, you are, man...
'cause your depression is boring me for one thing...
and it's actually making me a little depressed...
which is then in turn making me more depressed...
that you're actually affecting my mood.
Look, I'm not in any kind of place to talk to a woman, all right?
I'm just...
I'm fragile.
I hired her for you.
I hired a -pound girl to work in the stockroom at Smart Tech...
for you, okay?
I should have hired a -pound guy...
who could lift a -inch flat screen.
But instead I hired a hot girl...
who can't lift an iPod to bring you out of your funk.
You hired her for me?
Yes.
So will you go talk to her?
Yeah, I'm meeting somebody.
No.
Did you just flick me in the nuts?
No.
Flicked you in the fleshy patch where your nuts used to be.
Quit flicking my balls, man.
Okay, I'll stop flicking your balls.
But I'll start punching your nuts.
Oh!
Okay.
Well played, sir.
Okay.
Thank you.
No problem, man.
Go get 'em.
Mooj, you done see my son...
you know his foot gonna be bigger than this.
If that baby looks Pakistani, don't fucking look at me, okay?
I wouldn't mind.
You got good genes.
How old are you?
What, ?
When your son is born, is he already in parole?
I need some poon.
You guys were so right, right from the beginning.
I need genital to genital connection and that's all I need.
You know, the thing about relationships is that they...
make one person go...
And the other person go, "What are you talking about?" And then one person goes...
How much have you had to drink, man?
How much have I had to drink?
How many pots have you smoken?
What are you talking about?
How many times have you gone to the bathroom in your life?
Let me ask you that.
You know what, you don't have an answer for that, do you?
Fuck you, man!
I'm sorry.
No, you're such a good guy, and I appreciate you.
What's up, baby, I didn't know you had came already.
Hey, motherfucker!
Man, you know what, tonight is the night.
You know what, you were totally right and I was wrong.
You were right all along.
You cannot have a relationship...
with somebody until...
you have sex and that's the long...
That's the long and short of it.
So, thank you.
That's good.
And now I have to go hunt for some hos.
He going to be all right?
No, I don't think he is.
Cal's a good guy.
Yeah, he's a great guy.
It's so funny, because, you know...
when I first met him and I thought you were cute at the store...
he told me you were gay.
I'm not gay.
Cal says that I'm gay because he has a real problem...
with his own gayness.
But seriously, I'm going to lay it out for you, right now.
I was a little reticent to come over and talk to you.
You're very pretty and you seem very nice.
The truth is...
I dated this woman, let me rephrase that, I dated this whore...
who stomped all over my heart.
And it's just taking me a little while to kind of...
you know, get back in the game.
Oh, my God.
Say no more.
My last boyfriend Sal junior, is a scum bag.
I would totally pay people to have him killed.
That's how much I fucking hate that damn scum bag.
God, you're fucking awesome.
You too.
Hey, you!
Hey.
Hey.
How you doing?
Much better, now that I'm talking to you.
Hey, lookie, I can see through your shirt.
Nice.
So, you think we should...
take this party to my apartment or what?
I am RSVPing "yes." Hope you have a big trunk because I'm putting my bike in it.
Yeah, let's go!
Mom, I left my phone somewhere and I...
Thank you.
What's the matter?
Where is Andy?
We had a big fight, just...
Oh, Mom.
He just stormed out of here.
What happened?
Well, I just...
Wait a minute, I thought you hated him.
I don't hate him.
I mean, he does do magic, but...
you know, he's a big dork...
and I like seeing you happy.
I do.
That's sweet, that's really sweet.
Mom.
Why don't you just go talk to him, work it out.
'Cause if the thing is that important, you can't just stop.
Let me dance for you.
I would love it.
Look at your bra and your breasts and everything.
That's so great.
Wow!
You know what?
You're so hot.
You're so hot.
I'm smoking hot.
You know what?
I'm just going to have sex with you.
Yes!
Let's have sex.
It's going to happen.
That's why we are here.
That's totally what's going to happen.
We could do it in the...
Butt, if you want to.
But, if I want to what?
Butt.
But what?
What?
Do it.
Do it?
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Butt.
But...
What?
...what?
But, it still feels so right.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Right!
Okay.
Yeah.
That was a fun day.
You are so kinky.
Yeah, I'm so kinky.
That's why I did this because I thought it looks...
You like to shave, don't you?
Let's shave each other.
I don't think you have any hair.
You know where to shave me.
Yeah.
Because I want to shave you.
I want to shave your head.
I wanna give you a buzz cut.
Let's get in the bath.
In the bath?
Yes.
We're gonna get dirty.
Dirty, dirty.
Sudsy.
It's just about time I got really dirty.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hi, it's me, and I'm on my way to your house.
I want to do whatever you want to do, okay?
Fifty dates.
.
I hope not, but whatever.
I'm gonna see you soon, okay?
Bye.
Wow.
Okay, well, that was fast.
Okay.
Wow!
Holy shit!
Wow.
This is just the right thing to happen.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Wow!
Almost got my penis.
Come to mama.
I'm gonna really take care of you tonight.
You're never gonna forget Beth.
I just want to please you.
What do you like?
I don't know.
What do you like?
Can I show you what I like?
Okay.
It's so hot in here.
I wanna introduce you to my friend.
Your friend is so shiny.
This guy knows exactly what I like.
Where's you friend going?
This is how I'm gonna warm up for you.
That's always good to warm up.
You don't wanna pull something.
Wow, this is graphic.
I can't do it.
God, what are you doing here?
We came here because we were concerned about you and Trish...
and now I could not give a fuck.
How did you even know where she lives?
I hit it like eight months back.
What?
Never gave her back the key, man.
You have no idea...
where this is going, all right?
That girl is a freak.
Oh, it's happening!
It's happening!
Andy!
You think?
We've been talking, and look...
if you love Trish, you can't do this.
Look, you guys, I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
I don't even know who I am.
All I know is...
that woman scares the shit out of me...
and I just wanna go home, okay?
Let's go.
We should all get out of here.
Okay.
We should all go.
It wasn't that good for me.
We should totally get out of here.
We should run away from here.
Hey.
Cal.
Go around!
Come on, just go around me!
Can't you hear me?
Hey, there.
Hi, Trish.
Man, I'm really sorry about tonight.
What's this?
Those are David's.
I think he has a problem.
These are David's?
He's into that.
David's Boner Jams ' ?
Yeah, it's so sad.
He compiled all the best boner scenes, I guess.
This isn't what it looks like, okay?
What does this look like?
A vagina.
And what do you do with this vagina?
To learn.
It's for medicinal purposes.
Ugh.
Hey, I'm sorry.
God...
What's this?
This your date drug?
Your roofie?
It's a Mentos.
They're "The Freshmaker." Yeah, right.
What are you, some kind of sex pervert?
Are you a deviant or something?
No, I'm not a sexual deviant!
What is all this?
I haven't even tried to have sex with you, so...
What are you trying to do?
What are you buttering me up for?
Come on.
You're not gonna try and kill me, are you?
Look, Trish.
You didn't get a new carpet.
I'm not trying to kill you.
I love you.
I love you.
Oh, God!
Trish.
Trish.
No!
No.
Trish, stop.
Come on, Trish!
I need to talk to you!
No!
Damn it.
Oh, my God!
Andy!
Oh, my God!
Call .
Oh, my...
Andy.
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna need a minute.
I'm in a lot of pain right now.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Not bad.
There were two sides to that billboard.
And they both hurt equally.
Andy.
Andy.
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
No, I'm not okay.
I'm a virgin.
A what?
I'm a virgin.
I always have been.
Andy, is that what all this was about?
I'm sorry.
You're just a virgin, that's all?
Yeah.
That's good.
That's a good thing.
I feel stupid.
It's okay.
I thought you were trying to kill me.
No.
Oh, my God.
No, I'm not trying to kill you.
That's why I never tried to have sex with you.
I was scared, okay?
I just...
'Cause I didn't know what I was doing.
I just didn't think it would be good.
Of course it'll be good.
We love each other.
Really?
I love you.
Yeah.
Get the fuck out of the road, virgin!
Shut up, you fucking jerk!
No, that's okay.
That's all right.
Sorry.
You know what...
for so long I thought that there was something wrong with me...
because it had never happened, but...
I realize now that it was just because I was waiting for you.
This was some wedding.
How could they afford it?
Dude sells his toys and makes like a half a million dollars.
It's crazy, right?
That's fucking crazy.
We're gonna get some fucking toys.
We are all so happy for you.
I am delighted to say these words.
Andy...
you may kiss the bride.
And for God's sake, consummate the thing.
No!
Stop it.
I have the key.
I'm not gonna be done buffing the marble...
for about a half an hour, but...
you can come in and sit down if you want...
or wait in the lobby.
It's okay.
It's up to you.
Dude, get the fuck out of here.
Ready?
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
Whoa.
You're officially not a virgin.
Cool.
Wow.
Wanna do it again?
Yeah.
Good.
Okay.
Sure.
That was good.
That was okay.
Okay.
You ready?
Yeah.
Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm fine, yeah.
[<pre> Goddamn bugs.
Oh, shit!
Oh, crap.
Well, Nick the Dick.
What a surprise.
Where you coming from, Nick?
Fishing in Cuernavaca.
Sure you are.
Let's take a look at your catch.
Come on.
Me?
I would've thrown them back.
What do you get?
bucks a head?
?
Hope you saved it all for your lawyer.
You are gonna need it.
We'll take it from here.
Who the hell are you?
I.N.S., Division .
Division ?
I never heard of Division .
Really?
Who you got your money on, Dee?
Tough call, Kay.
We've got a winner here.
Oh, I know.
Sir-- Don't 'sir'me, young man.
You have no idea who you're dealing with.
We're going to chat with our friend.
You can hit the road.
Keep on protecting us from the dangerous aliens.
You ever hear of Division ?
There is no Division .
This is bullshit.
Hell, yeah.
Looks like you fell off the bus in the wrong part of town, amigo.
I'll bet dollars to pesos you're not from anywhere near here.
Mikey?
When did they let you out of jail?
Political refugee.
Right.
You know how many treaties you just violated?
One!
Try seven.
That's enough, Mikey.
You hand me that head.
Put up your arms and all your flippers.
Shit.
Shoot him!
That.
...wa-wa-wa-- Was not human.
I know.
You got some entrails on you, pal.
What the hell?
The situation's under control.
Calm down, please.
Give me your attention for a moment.
I'll tell you what happened.
This is called a neuralizer.
It's a gift from some friends from out of town.
This red eye isolates...
the electronic impulses in your brains, specifically memory.
Fellas, give me a splay burn around the perimeter with holes...
at and meters from right here.
Thank you.
Good.
Thank you.
What in the hell is going on?
Excellent question.
The answer you're looking for lies right here.
Who are you, really?
Really?
I am just a figment of your imagination.
Damn, what a gullible breed.
I'm serious, fellas.
You're lucky to be alive after a blast like that.
What blast?
The underground gas vein, genius.
You should exercise a lot more caution before firing.
I'll tell you that right now.
Especially you.
Have yourselves checked out with E.M.S.
before you leave.
I'm sorry about back there.
That happens.
Didn't used to.
The spirit's willing, Kay, but...
the rest of me-- They're beautiful, aren't they?
What?
The stars.
We never just look anymore.
No.
I'll tell you, Kay...
I will miss the chase.
I will miss the chase.
No, Dee...
you won't.
Freeze!
N.Y.P.D., freeze!
All yours, Edwards.
Freeze means stop!
What the hell?
It just be raining black people in New York.
Do you see this?
N.Y.P.D.!
It means I will knock your punk-ass down!
He's coming!
Yeah, and when he gets here, I'll arrest his ass too.
You trying to catch a beat down?
What's up?
He's coming.
He's coming because I failed.
Now he'll kill me.
You pissing everybody off today, huh?
You don't understand.
Your world's going to end.
What the hell are you?
Watch that ledge.
Watch it.
Come down.
We'll get those eyes fixed.
Don't even worry about it.
Wait a minute.
Let me talk to you!
I go out.
I work my butt off to make a living.
All I want is to come home to a nice clean house...
with a nice fat steak on the table...
but instead I get this.
Looks like poison.
but instead I get this.
Looks like poison.
Don't you take that away!
I'm eating that, damn it!
It is poison, isn't it?
I swear to God, I wouldn't be surprised if it was...
the way you skulk around like a dog been hit too much.
Or ain't been hit enough!
I can't make up my mind.
You're useless, Beatrice.
The only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck!
Figures.
What the heck is it, Edgar?
Get your big butt back in the house.
Place projectile weapon on the ground.
You can have my gun...
when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers.
Your proposal is acceptable.
Edgar, what on earth was that?
Sugar.
I've never seen sugar do that.
Give me sugar.
In water.
More.
More.
Your skin is hanging off your bones.
Oh, yeah.
Is that better?
'The perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids.' You mean blinked with both eyes?
No, sir.
He blinked one set, then a completely different set.
You know, like high beams and low beams.
Was that before...
or after he drew the weapon that you claim evaporated into a million pieces?
After, sir.
Why is it that no other officers saw either of these events?
Some other officers are soggy around the midsection.
I guess that's why they couldn't keep up.
If you were half the man I am-- What the hell?
I am half the man that you are.
What is your problem?
You being all up in my damn face.
I think he threw him off the roof.
Maybe you're next.
I want to talk to you.
Now.
Ten minutes, take your best shot.
Take ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you pudgy bastard.
I believe you.
Laurel Weaver, Deputy Medical Examiner.
Find me at the morgue on th.
I'll show you.
Wait.
Wait a minute!
You're Dr Weaver with the coroner's office working on theJohn Doe?
Yes, that's right.
Will you look at this, please?
Some night, huh?
Yeah, some night.
They were gills, not eyelids.
Gills.
He was out of breath.
Who are you?
Did he say anything to you?
Yeah, the world was coming to an end.
Did he say when?
Would you recognize his weapon if you saw it again?
Absolutely.
Come on.
Let's take a ride.
Wait a minute.
Look, I got tons of paperwork-- Right.
It's all done.
Good work, Edwards.
You really ran this dude down on foot?
That's tough, kid.
That's double tough.
So who exactly are you with?
So who exactly are you with?
F.B.I.?
N.S.A.?
I'm part of a bureau that licenses, monitors and polices...
alien activity on the planet Earth.
Whatever.
We're here.
This is where we're going?
Yeah.
This is JackJeebs'spot.
He buys from chain snatchers.
He doesn't even sell guns.
Really?
All right, look.
I'll slide in and put my thing down.
But when I come out I want answers.
Go put your thing down.
Officer Eduardo.
How did these get here?
I thought I turned them in to the authorities.
The way I hear it you're into something hotter than stolen Rolexes.
I'm a huge crack dealer now, but I work here as I love the hours.
I'm talking about guns, smart ass.
Weird ones.
Come on.
What you see is what I got.
Why don't you show him the imports,Jeebs?
Hiya, Kay.
How are you?
Show him the imports right now.
I got out of that business a long time ago.
Why do you lie to me?
I hate it.
-Just hold on a second.
I'm gonna count to three.
He'll do it,Jeebs.
One...
That man does not look stable.
He's crazy when he's like this.
He's always crazy.
Why don't you get a massage?
Take a cruise.
Drop the weapon.
Hands on your head!
I warned him.
Drop it!
Don't make me kill you.
You warned him.
You insensitive prick!
Do you have any idea how much that stings?
Show us the merchandise or you'll lose another head,Jeebs.
Mr Edwards?
Right there.
The one in the middle.
You sold a reverberating carbonizer with mutate capacity...
to an unlicensed cephlapoid!
Jeebs, you piece of-- He looked all right to me.
Assassination.
Who's the target?
I don't know.
Goddamn it,Jeebs!
I don't know!
All that's confiscated.
I want you on the next transport off this rock...
or I'll shoot you where it don't grow back.
And I'm going to be back to talk about them Rolexes.
Searching for a handle on the moment?
I can't help you.
The only comfort I can offer...
is my promise that tomorrow morning you won't remember a thing.
That's not exactly some shit you just forget.
Ever seen one of these?
She looks over to her husband...
then sets it back down in her lap and says...
'Honey, this one's eating my popcorn.' Get it?
Yeah.
'Eating my popcorn.' Gotta go.
Thanks for the egg rolls, kid.
Wait a minute.
Who are you?
See what I mean about tequila?
You're a bright young man,James.
But you need to lay off the sauce.
I'll see you bright and early, : .
Be there...
or be square.
Well, well, well.
Moving right in, are we?
Think we own the place?
I got an eviction notice for you boys.
Just what exactly do you think you're doing here?
Taking care of your pest problem.
Pest problem?
Pest?
Yeah, you got a hell of an infestation.
You know, I've noticed an infestation here.
Everywhere I look in fact.
Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum...
totally convinced of their own superiority...
as they scurry about their short...
pointless lives.
Well, yeah.
Don't you want to get rid of them?
In the worst way.
Help you?
This dude gave me this card-- Elevator.
You're late.
Sit down.
My name is Zed.
You're all here because you're the best of the best.
Marines, Air Force, Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, N.Y.P.D.
And we're looking for one of you.
Just one.
What will follow is a series of simple tests...
for motor skills, concentration, stamina.
I see we have a question.
I'm sorry, maybe you already answered this but...
why exactly are we here?
Son.
Second LieutenantJakeJensen.
West Point.
Graduate with honors.
We're here because you want the best of the best of the best, sir!
What's so funny, Edwards?
Your boy, Captain America, here.
'The best of the best of the best, sir!' 'With honors.' He's just really excited, and he has no clue why we're here.
That's very funny to me.
Y'all ain't laughing, though.
Okay, let's get going.
Want to get down on this?
Edwards, what the hell happened?
Hesitated.
May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die?
She was the only one that actually seemed dangerous at the time, sir.
How'd you decide that?
First, I was going to pop this guy hanging from the streetlight...
but I realized he's just working out.
How'd I feel if somebody bust me in my ass while I'm on the treadmill?
Then I saw this snarling beast guy...
and I noticed he had a tissue in his hand and realized...
he's not snarling, he's sneezing.
Ain't no real threat there.
Then I saw Tiffany.
I'm thinking, eight-year-old white girl, middle of the ghetto...
bunch of monsters at night with quantum physics books.
She about to start some shit, Zed.
She's about eight.
Those books are way too advanced for her.
If you ask me, she's up to something.
Honestly, I'd appreciate it if you eased up off my back about it.
Or do I owe her an apology?
That was a good shot though, right?
He's got a real problem with authority.
So do I.
But this kid ran down a cephlapoid on foot, boss.
That's got to be tough enough.
Let's hope you know what you're doing.
Gentlemen.
Congratulations.
You're all we've come to expect...
from years of government training.
If you'll just follow me, we have one more test.
An eye exam.
Where are you going?
Hey, man, what the hell is all this?
In the mid s the government started an underfunded agency...
with the simple and laughable purpose of establishing contact...
with a race not of this planet.
Look directly at the end of this device.
Everyone thought the agency was a joke, except the aliens...
who made contact March , outside New York.
There were nine of us the first night.
Seven agents, one astronomer...
and one dumb kid who got lost on the wrong back road.
Oh, you brought that tall man some flowers.
This way.
They were a group of intergalactic refugees.
Wanted Earth for an apolitical zone for creatures without a planet.
Did you ever see 'Casablanca'?
Same thing, except no Nazis.
We agreed and concealed all the evidence of their landing.
So these are real flying saucers...
and the World's Fair was a cover-up for their landing?
Why else hold it in Queens?
More nonhumans arrive every year and live among us in secret.
Look, I'm sorry.
Not to change the subject...
but when was the last time you had a CAT scan?
Six months ago.
It's company policy.
Make another appointment.
Tell your boy Zed I had an absolutely wonderful time...
and thank you for everything but show me the door.
All right.
I'm going to get some coffee.
You want some coffee?
No, thank you, I'm fine.
How you doing, fellas?
Shit!
Okay.
That's not decaf, is it?
Viennese cinnamon.
Don't tell me we only got powdered stuff for cream.
I hate that stuff.
Well, that's good.
Good.
Good.
You guys getting along all right?
Don't work too hard.
So, you guys seen the cahuengas on-- Sure you don't want coffee?
Cahuengas, yeah, but how about the zapoata?
All right, kid, here's the deal.
At any given time there are around , aliens on the planet.
Most of them right here in Manhattan.
Most of them are decent enough.
Just trying to make a living.
Cab drivers.
Not as many as you'd think.
Humans, for the most part, don't have a clue.
Don't want or need one.
They're happy.
They think they have a good bead on things.
Why the big secret?
People are smart.
They can handle it.
A person is smart.
People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals.
You know it.
Fifteen hundred years ago, everybody knew...
the Earth was the center of the universe.
Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat.
And fifteen minutes ago, you knew that people were alone on this planet.
Imagine what you'll know...
tomorrow.
What's the catch?
The catch.
The catch is you will sever every human contact.
Nobody will ever know you exist anywhere.
Ever.
I'll give you to sunrise to think it over.
Is it worth it?
Yeah, it's worth it...
if you're strong enough.
What's up, pops?
All right, I'm in...
because there's some next-level shit going on here, and I'm with that.
But before y'all beam me up, there's a few things to understand.
First off, you chose me...
so you recognize the skills.
I don't want nobody calling me 'son' or 'kid'or 'sport.'Cool?
Whatever you say, slick.
But I need to tell you something about all your skills.
As of right now...
As of right now...
they mean precisely...
dick.
Purpose of trip?
Diplomatic mission.
Duration of stay?
Lunch.
Any fruits or vegetables?
You want to stay away from that guy.
He's grouchy.
Three-hour delay in customs after a trillion mile trip...
gonna make anybody cranky.
Right?
What branch of the government do we report to?
None, they ask too many questions.
So who pays for all this?
We hold patents on a few gadgets we confiscated from the visitors.
Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction.
This is a fascinating little gadget.
It'll replace CDs soon.
Guess I'll have to buy the 'White Album'again.
That's fun.
It's a universal translator.
We're not even supposed to have it.
I'll tell you why.
Human thought is so primitive it's looked upon...
as an infectious disease in some of the better galaxies.
That kind of makes you proud, doesn't it?
What's this?
Just be calm.
Relax!
Watch your head!
Somebody get him some ice.
Move!Just move when it's coming at you!
Damn!
I'm going to pay for that!
This thing caused the New York blackout.
Practical joke by the Great Attractor.
He thought it was funny as hell.
Sorry, y'all.
It was a accident.
Sorry.
Observation, the heart of our little endeavor.
Meet the twins Blblup and Bob.
This map shows the location of every registered alien on Earth...
at any given time.
Some are under constant surveillance.
Everyone on those screens is an alien.
In public, they're normal as you are, but in private, well...
You'll get the idea.
Oh, man.
Doesn't make any sense, does it?
Well, no, it makes perfect sense.
When I was in third grade, everyone said I was crazy...
but I knew our teacher was from Venus or something like that.
Ms Edelson.Jupiter, actually.
Well, one of the moons.
Class...
be quiet and pay attention!
If I have to tell you one more time-- Edwards!
Let's put it on.
Put what on?
The last suit you'll ever wear.
You will dress only in attire specially sanctioned...
by MIB special services.
You'll conform to the identity we give you.
Eat where we tell you.
Live where we tell you.
From now on...
you'll have no identifying marks of any kind.
You'll not stand out in any way.
Your entire image is crafted to leave...
no lasting memory with anyone you encounter.
You are a rumor...
recognizable only as déjà vu and dismissed just as quickly.
You don't exist.
You were never even born.
Anonymity is your name.
Silence,your native tongue.
You're no longer part of the system.
You're above the system.
Over it.
Beyond it.
We're 'them.
'We're 'they.
' We are the Men in Black.
You know what the difference is between you and me?
I make this look good.
We're going to go for a ride.
I'll put you down here for a minute then Daddy will be right back.
Okay, now we're ready to go for a little ride.
We're going to meet with Daddy's friend who you'll like.
Let's see.
Bee...
we've got the deposed sur-prefect of Singalee...
touching down in the forest outside Portland tonight.
Humanoid?
You wish.
Bring a sponge.
And here.
Red letter from last night.
We had an unauthorized landing somewhere in upstate New York.
Kay, keep your ears open on this one.
We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger down here.
Well, we got a skimmer.
Landed alien out of zone.
Who is it?
Redgick.
He's not cleared to leave Manhattan...
but he's way out of town now, stuck on the New Jersey Turnpike.
Why don't you take junior with you?
This is a good one for him to warm up on.
Go get him, tiger.
'We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger.' Zed.
He just...
Unlimited technology from the whole universe...
and we cruise around in a Ford P.O.S.
Fasten your seat belt.
We got to work on your people skills.
You'd get a much better reaction if you were more polite.
Fasten your seat belt, please.
Good.
Did you hurt yourself?
Oh, the red button there.
Don't ever, ever touch it.
All right, pop, that'll be $ there.
Okay, sweetie, let me pay the impolite driver.
Six is up!
Where is Ivan?
Gave him a break.
You can kill us both, but you will not find the galaxy.
You're right about one thing.
You're not going anywhere, pal.
What's going on?
I'd like to see your license and registration, please.
Like to see your other license and registration, please.
You're restricted to Manhattan.
Where are you going, Redgie?
It's my wife.
She's-Well, look.
All right.
No big deal.
Okay, you come with me, Redge.
And you handle this.
What!
Me?
It's easy.
You just catch.
He knows what he's doing?
He does it all the time.
Let the man work.
Damn, man!
So-- Something's peaking!
Croagg the midwife is at th and Madison.
You're headed out of town.
What's going on?
We're meeting someone.
Who you meeting?
It's a ship.
I saw no departure clearance for today.
You didn't?
No.
It's an emergency.
Kay!
Kay!
You're doing fine, ace.
Kiss my ass!
What kind of emergency?
What's the rush to get off the planet?
Excuse me, miss.
We just don't like the neighborhood anymore.
Some of the new arrivals.
New arrivals?
Have anything to do with the crash last night?
Excuse me, miss!
Oh, man.
Oh, man!
Look.
Oh, man.
Congratulations, Redge.
It's a...
squid.
He's...
actually kind of...
cute.
Anything about that seem unusual to you?
What would scare Redgick so badly he'd risk a warp jump with a newborn?
We'll check the hot sheets.
These are the hot sheets?
Best investigative reporting on the planet.
Read the 'New York Times'if you want.
They get lucky sometimes.
I cannot believe you're looking for tips in the supermarket tabloids.
Not looking for.
Found.
Wait, slow down.
Why?
Give her time to get the wrong impression.
Makes things smoother.
Can I help you, gentlemen?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Agent Manheim, this is Agent Black, with the F.B.I.
We'd like to talk about your visitor.
You here to make fun of me too?
We at the F.B.I.
do not have a sense of humor we're aware of.
May we come in?
Sure.
Thank you.
Lemonade?
Oh, yes, please.
The chief of police himself come up to the house...
and did a full-out professional investigation.
Took a police report and writ down everything I said...
from A to Z, not believing one thing I said.
Sort of poking fun at me.
Then they asked, 'If he was murdered...
how was he able to walk back in the house?' I gotta admit to you that one got me sorta stumped.
But I know Edgar and that wasn't Edgar.
It was like something was wearing Edgar.
Like a suit.
An Edgar suit.
Dude was that ugly before he was an alien.
I'm sorry.
Go on.
Anyway...
I come to and he's gone.
Did he say anything?
Yes.
He asked me for some water.
Some sugar water.
Sugar water?
Yeah, I remember that right.
'Cause I thought that was odd.
That he asked me for sugar water and not lemonade or ice water or...
regular water or...
tap water.
All right, Beatrice.
There was no alien.
The flash of light you saw in the sky was not a U.F.O.
Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket...
and refracted the light from Venus.
Wait a minute.
You flash that thing...
it erases her memory and you just make up a new one?
A standard-issue neuralizer.
That weak-ass story is the best you can come up with?
All right.
On a more personal note, Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend.
You'll go stay with your mom a couple nights.
You'll get over it and decide you're better off.
Yeah, because he never appreciated you anyway.
In fact, you know what?
You kicked him out.
And now that he's gone...
you'll go into town, find yourself some nice dresses.
Get yourself some shoes.
Find somewhere you could get a facial.
And...
hire a decorator to come here quick because, damn!
Yo, Kay, check it out.
When do I get my own flashy...
memory messer-upper thing?
When you grow up.
Please, not green.
Damn.
I don't suppose you know what kind of alien life-form...
leaves a green spectral trail and craves sugar water?
Wait.
That was on 'FinalJeopardy'last night.
Damn, Alex said it was-- Zed, we have a bug.
So.
What?
We don't like bugs?
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.
They consume, infest, destroy, live off the destruction of other species.
You were stung as a child, right?
Listen, kid.
Imagine a giant cockroach with unlimited strength...
a massive inferiority complex, and a real short temper...
is tear-assing around Manhattan Island in a brand-new Edgar suit.
Sound like fun?
What's the move?
With the bug in town, we'll watch the morgues.
Where do you want contestant number three?
Just leave it there.
What's with the cat?
There's a problem with the cat.
Sign here.
What's the problem with the cat?
It's your problem.
I hate the living.
Shall we?
Oh, my God!
Buddy, what are you?
Subject was approximately degrees at time of autopsy...
indicating an increase in body temperature.
Examiner tried to verify this rectally...
only to find the subject was without rectum.
Which is, needless to say, really-- Weird.
I'm Dr Leo Manville, Department of Public Health.
This is Dr White.
You boys must not have much of a home life.
We watch the morgues very carefully.
Seen something unusual?
I'd say so.
Triple homicide.
The first body was pretty normal, except he was broken in half.
The first body was pretty normal, except he was broken in half.
But when I opened up the other two, well-Let me show you.
There's a skeletal structure unlike any I've ever seen before.
I'll look at it.
Dr White, why don't you and Dr Weaver check out the other body?
This way, Doctor.
This one's even stranger.
I did a full laparotomy.
I began with the stomach.
We can start with the gastroesophageal junction.
Whichever you prefer.
Let's start wherever you started at.
Okeydokey.
Your cat?
Guess it is now.
It came in with the body.
Dive right in.
I'm sure he won't mind.
You have really pretty eyes.
Thank you.
Feel that?
Where the pyloric junction would be?
Push it aside.
Notice anything strange?
Stomach, liver, lungs?
No, all fine.
Doctor, they're all missing.
Well, of course.
That's obviously the first thing I noticed.
What I was pointing out is the fact that there are no...
pieces...
of them left.
You know, so they're intact.
Wherever they are.
Whole, somewhere.
That we can be sure of.
Have we met before?
I'm having the strangest feeling of déjà vu.
Yeah, me too.
Really?
Okay, you want to know what I really think?
But don't tell him, he's under enough stress.
I don't think it's a real body.
I think it's some kind of transport unit for something else altogether.
The question is, what?
Is this freaking you out?
No, girl.
You know what I like to do sometimes when it's late?
No.
Dr White.
Excuse me.
What do you think?
Very interesting.
She got a real Queen-of-the-Undead thing going-- Of the body.
Great body.
The dead body.
Man, you have to look at that thing.
You recognize him?
Yeah, he looks like the big guy I saw down at headquarters, only deader.
What do you think killed him?
A bug?
Dr White.
You're up, slugger.
Look at this.
What the hell is that?
Must...
To prevent...
contest.
It's okay.
What are you trying to say?
To prevent...
'To prevent...' Struggle?
No.
To prevent...
War?
War.
The galaxy...
...is on...
...Orion's...
...bebe-- What is word?
The bed?
Belt?
Orion's belt?
'To prevent war the galaxy is on Orion's belt.' What the hell does that mean?
Doctor...
whatever, come here!
Dr 'Whatever'?
You guys aren't really from the Department of Health, are you?
Rosenberg!
Ah, damn.
The Arquillians will not like this.
He was one of the royal family.
I knew it.
This is an alien.
And you're from some government agency trying to keep it under wraps.
He said, 'To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's belt.' This makes total sense.
How else do you explain New York?
The other day I was in this cab and this guy-- 'Galaxy on Orion's belt' doesn't make sense.
That's what the little dude inside the big dude's head said.
Right?
Right after-- Damn, man.
You did the flashy thing already.
Whoever you are, you have to show I.D.
if you're gonna be in the morgue.
Of course, young lady.
Look at this for me, please.
Would you stop that?
What?
That thing is gonna give her brain cancer or something.
Never hurt her before.
We have to close all the doors here.
Special Services will be here any minute.
'Before'!
How many times have you flashy-thinged that poor woman?
Couple.
No worries about no long-term damage?
Little.
Have you ever flashy-thinged me?
No.
I ain't playing with you!
Have you?
No.
I think I should be in charge of the flashy thing department.
Not while I'm around, ace.
You won't be happy till you fricassee someone's brain out.
We got two dead aliens and a Deputy Medical Examiner...
that needs a new memory.
Yes, sir.
Make it a happy memory.
Where is it?
Hey, Zed.
Doesn't anyone ever get any sleep around here?
The twins keep us on Centaurian time.
It's a -hour day.
Give it a few months, you'll get used to it.
Or have a psychotic episode.
Here's Orion.
It's a grouping of the brightest stars in the northern sky.
And here's Orion's belt.
That's what the little guy said.
'To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's belt.' Junior, there are no galaxies on Orion's belt.
The belt is just these three stars.
Galaxies are huge.
They're made up of billions of stars.
You heard wrong.
Look, whatever, I know what I heard.
Pretty lady.
The grumpy guy's story is starting to come into focus a little bit here.
You were the guy in the picture you showed me with the flowers.
And, I take it, she never got those flowers.
So, what, she ever get married or anything?
You know what they say.
'It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.' Try it.
Take a look at this.
My God, they're all leaving.
We've had jump in the last hour.
Redgick was just the first.
What do they know that we don't?
Why does a rat desert a ship?
Give me Lem Sat with a proton induction thermoscan, please.
Thank you.
Okay.
Lem Sat .
All right, .
That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.
We've got a dead Arquillian prince.
Speak of the devil.
They sound pissed.
Boys, translate that.
Step on it.
Go to Rosenberg's jewelry store and see what you can turn up.
Give the kid a weapon.
Series de-atomizer.
That's what I'm talking about.
Noisy cricket.
Kay, no, no, come on, man.
You get a Series de-atomizer...
I get a midget cricket?
Feel like I'm going to break this damn thing.
Hey, this is my truck!
Make sure you tell them that down at the impound.
Please.
Who breaks into a jewelry store and leaves all the jewels?
Somebody not looking for jewelry.
He had a serious crush on his cat.
Get down!
Man!
That's him.
That's the bug!
In the Edgar suit!
We do not discharge our weapons in view of the public!
We ain't got time for this cover-up bullshit!
Have you forgotten?
There's an alien battle cruiser-- There's always an alien battle cruiser or a Korilian death ray...
or an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this planet.
The only way people get on with their happy lives...
is they do not know about it!
Don't worry about the bug.
He's not leaving town.
We've got his ship.
Zed, we need a containment crew...
on MacDougal Street south of Houston.
Containment may be a moot point, friend.
The exodus continues.
It's like the party's over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check.
You sorry little ingrates!
What about the Arquillians?
We've only translated part of the message so far: 'Deliver the galaxy.' They don't want much, do they?
Oh, it gets better.
They hold us responsible.
Where do you keep your dead?
I don't have any dead.
Where?
I don't know.
The city morgue?
That's three for a dollar, sir!
It was some light that refracted off of Venus...
into some swamp gas...
and that's what made the-- All right, kid!
Excuse me.
What's up?
The Arquillians want the galaxy, whatever the hell that means.
We need help, a professional.
Somebody with years of experience in intergalactic politics.
I just hope the little prick hasn't skipped town.
May I have your attention?
Thank you.
If you'll gather over here.
That's right, move in closer.
That's good.
If you look right here, I'd appreciate it.
Thank you.
That's the worse disguise ever.
He's obviously an alien.
You don't like it, you can kiss my furry little butt.
You busy, Frank?
Can't talk now.
My flight's leaving in-- Get your paws off me!
Call the pound!
We got a stray.
The dog owes my friend money.
Arquillians and bugs, Frank, what do you know?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Stop it.
Stop it.
Okay.
Okay.
Rosenberg wasn't some two-bit Arquillian.
He was the guardian of a whole galaxy.
They thought he'd be safe on Earth.
The bug had other plans.
The galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe.
If the bugs get their slimy claws on it, kiss the Arquillians good-bye.
Ask about the belt.
Rosenberg mentioned a galaxy on Orion's belt.
What's he mean?
Beats me.
Not around.
They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.
The galaxy is here!
What do you mean 'here'?
Galaxy's millions of stars and planets.
How's it here?
You humans!
When will you learn size doesn't matter?
Just because something's important, doesn't mean it's not very small.
How small?
Tiny.
Like a marble or a jewel.
If you'll excuse me, I gotta be walked before my flight.
All right.
Get out of here.
If the galaxy's here, it's not on Orion's belt.
Boy, when you want attention-- Orion.
That's a pretty name.
What's this?
Yes, good, thank you.
Thank you for making sure the bell works.
What's up, FarmerJohn?
A man came in here earlier.
A dead man.
And that means what to me?
It was a very dear friend of mine.
I believe he had an animal with him.
It was a gift I gave him.
A pet cat.
It means worlds to me.
I'd like to have it back.
I'm gonna need a picture I.D...
written proof of ownership of the cat...
notarized proof of kinship with...
the deceased.
Don't do that.
Do what?
Don't do it.
Oh, man.
Look, Kay, let me handle this one.
What?
All we gotta do is get a cat.
It's not really that hard.
But if you go in, you'll lay yourJack Webb on her.
Flash your brain ray all in her face.
She'll wind up with leukemia.
She's a doctor.
She don't need you flashing away her med school classes.
Five minutes.
Two minutes.
Where's the animal?
I told you I don't know.
Let's see if we can find it.
Hello!
Hello!
How you doing?
Hello.
I'm Sergeant Friday, from the th precinct.
A cat came in with a corpse the other day.
'Orion'on the name tag.
Yes, that's right.
This cat is a...
a witness in a murder case.
I'm gonna need to take him, ask him a few questions.
I don't know where the cat is.
You don't?
No, but maybe you could take me with you instead.
Damn, you do start fast, don't you?
I'd really like to go with you...
now.
And exactly why is that?
There's something I need to show you.
Slow down, girl.
You ain't got to hit the gas like that.
You don't understand.
You really need to see this.
I will, I will.
One thing, I got to drive.
It's not some macho trip.
I'm saying that's the way I get down.
Look, stud, you're really not getting this.
There's something I need you to help me with.
Freeze it, bug!
Christ, you are thick!
How was I to know?
Should I have sung it for you?
If you weren't coming on like-- That is so typical.
A woman shows a hint of sexual independence-- Shut up!
Let her go, shiteater.
Listen, monkey-boy.
Compared to you humans, I'm on the top rung of the evolutionary ladder.
So can it.
You're breaking my heart.
Show me your face and I'll cure all your ills.
Ever pull wings off a fly?
Care to see the fly get even?
How far can you go with no ship?
If that's what you call that space trash we got locked in the office.
Put your weapons down!
Never going to happen, insect.
It's okay.
How is it okay?
I'm saying it's going to be okay.
Don't bet on it, meat sack.
Let me go!
Go on!
Take me here.
No way.
Take me!
He's in a cab!
Don't move!
Don't move!
Don't move!
Hey, man, what?
He's not leaving the planet in a cab.
Let's go.
Come with me.
Put up a bio-net all the way around Manhattan.
If it's not human, I don't want it to leave this island.
What do we hear from our friends upstairs?
Same thing.
'Deliver the galaxy.' The bug has the galaxy but we have his ship.
He's looking for a way out.
Warning.
Protonic fusion detection.
What the hell they shooting at us for?
Battle rules, kid.
First, we get an ultimatum...
then a warning shot, then a galactic standard week to respond.
A galactic standard week?
How long is that?
One hour.
One hour?
Then what?
That's bullshit.
Kid, to keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy the galaxy.
And whatever planet it's on.
You're talking about us.
Sucks, huh?
I'm getting the location of every interstellar vehicle within miles.
I already did.
Frank took the last ship.
Snedens Landing and Throg's Neck.
They're gone.
Atlantic City.
Adios.
Bayonne?
Gone.
There's Three Mile Island.
Gone.
Y'all.
Staten Island?
Gone, thank God.
Fellas!
We're running out of time.
If the bug leaves with the galaxy-- Hey, old guys!
Do those still work?
You're coming with me.
What?
It's a long trip.
I'll need a snack.
It's a long trip.
I'll need a snack.
Wait, the tunnel?
You know a better way to Queens?
It's gonna be packed.
Remember the little red button?
Yeah.
Push the red button.
You may want to wear a seat belt.
You're much too tense.
You're a young man.
You need to relax.
Learn to take some joy in your work.
You like music?
Man!
That's better.
You do know Elvis is dead?
No, Elvis is not dead.
He just went home.
You don't want to eat me.
I'm important on my planet.
A queen!
A goddess, even.
There are those who worship me.
I'm not trying to impress you.Just letting you know it could start a war!
Good, war.
That means more food for my family.
All million of them.
That's a lot of mouths to feed.
Wonderful, but I'm staying here!
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
Roaches check in.
But they don't check out.
Warning.
Eight minutes to the destruction of Earth.
Eight minutes to destruction.
We'll use pulsar level with a sub-sonic implosion factor.
What?
Just shoot the damn thing on the count of three.
One...
two, three.
You idiots!
You don't get it!
I've won.
It's over.
It's over.
You milk suckers!
You don't matter.
In a few seconds, you won't even be matter.
You're under arrest for violating sections of the Tycho Treaty.
So hand over whatever galaxy you are carrying and step away...
from your busted-ass vehicle and put your hands on your head.
I'll put my hands...
on my head.
Like this?
That did not go at all how I'd planned.
Whatever happens, don't let him on the second ship.
What are you talking about?
Keep him on this planet.
Kay, where are you going?
I'm getting my gun back.
Hey, bug!
You know how many of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?
You're nothing but a smear on the sports page to me...
you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite!
Eat me!
Eat me!
What's up?
You just going to eat and run, huh?
What about dessert?
That's it?
Where you going?
This party's just getting started.
Where're you going?
Where you going?
Listen.
There's one way off this planet, baby, and that's through me.
Where're you going?
Why you runnin', huh?
I'm still standing.
Come on.
Bring it.
Bring it.
I'm sorry.
Was that your auntie?
That must mean that's your uncle, huh?
You know you all look alike.
Well, well.
Big bad bug got a bit of a soft spot, huh?
What I can't understand is why you...
got to come down here bringing all this ruckus.
Snatching up galaxies and everything.
My attitude is, don't start nothing, won't be nothing.
You need to ease up out my face before something bad happen to you.
Too late.
Call the Arquillians.
Tell them we have the galaxy.
You got it, friend.
Going to get your gun back, huh?
I like this gun.
While you were in there playing around, I was here doing all the work.
First, I had to bean him in the head with this big rock.
Then I was going to hit him with a two-by-four.
He kicked me.
You know, it hurt.
Then I got the fire.
I was 'yah'with the fire.
Not bad for your second day of work, is it?
This definitely rates about a .
on my weird-shit-o-meter.
Should've been here for the Zeronion migration in .
I guess you weren't even alive in ' .
Interesting job you guys have.
Look, I know we got rules and everything, but...
she did help us bust that bug.
Maybe we don't have to flashy thing her.
Come on.
Who she gonna tell?
She hang out with all dead people.
It's not for her.
It's for me.
What?
They're beautiful, aren't they?
Stars.
I never look at them anymore, but they actually are quite...
beautiful.
Kay, you're frightening your partner.
I haven't been training a partner.
I've been training a replacement.
Wait a minute, Kay.
I cannot do this job by myself.
Hey, guys.
My apartment isn't anywhere near here.
It's not even on the same island.
Days...
months...
years.
Always face it forward.
I've just been down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach, kid.
That's one of a hundred memories that I don't want.
See you around,Jay.
No...
you won't.
Zed called.
The Solaxiant consulate wants floor seats for the Knicks game.
Put in a call for Dennis Rodman, he's from that planet.
Rodman?
You're kidding.
Nope.
[<pre> Them niggas around the corner tripped out, man.
Fuck that shit, man!
Let's go.
I'll take my car.
Oh, fuck that.
We should've let these niggas have it.
Just pull up, just pull up.
Get your shit ready, nigga.
Damn!
These niggas here?
All right, hold up.
Get ready, get ready.
Look out, nigga!
What's up, punk?!
Possible 187 at corner of Crenshaw and Century.
They shot my brother!
Tre, you do your homework?
What homework?
Yeah, I did it.
Can I copy it?
Hell, no.
Too bad, you should've done it.
Did you hear the shooting last night?
Yeah, I got under my bed.
Man, you a scaredy-cat.
My mama say, "A bullet don't have no name on it." I ain't afraid.
My brothers been shot and they still alive.
They lucky.
Y'all want to see something?
What?
I ain't saying what.
Want to see it or not?
Is that blood?
What happened?
Somebody got smoked.
Look at the hole in the wall, stupid.
Least I can tell my times tables.
Look!
Why is the blood turning yellow?
That's what happens when it separates from the plasma.
So that's how the settlers survived that long hard winter...
...that took so many of their lives, is by eating foods...
...that were given to them, like the turkey and the squash...
...and all the foods that we think of as our traditional holiday meal.
And that's why we celebrate Thanksgiving...
...to commemorate the unity between the Indians...
...excuse me...
...the Native Americans...
...and the early English settlers who were called...
Class?
Pilgrims.
That's right, the Pilgrims.
Very good.
The penguins!
Who said that?
Mr Styles.
That's me.
How is it you always have something funny to say?
Because I'm a comedian.
Would you like to come up and teach the class?
Yeah, I can do that.
Very well, come on up.
Instruct us.
What's the basis of your lecture?
What?
What are you going to talk about?
I'd tell you if you let me talk.
What's the name of this place?
That's Africa.
I know that.
Right, that's Africa.
Did you know that Africa is where the body of the first man was found?
My daddy says that's where all people originated from.
That means everybody's really from Africa.
Everybody.
All y'all.
Everybody.
I ain't from Africa.
I'm from Crenshaw Mafia!
Like it or not, you from Africa.
I ain't from Africa.
You from Africa.
You African booty-scratcher!
Quiet.
Punk, I'll kick your ass.
That's enough.
Count to 10 and be quiet.
I'll get my brother to shoot you!
Get your brother, bitch!
I'll get my daddy.
Least I got one.
I ain't your bitch.
Ain't nobody's bitch, bitch!
Are you listening to me?
Sit down, now!
That's enough!
As I said, he's highly intelligent.
He has an enormous vocabulary.
It's just that...
Yes, go on.
It's just that he has a very bad temper.
It's extremely difficult for him to interact with the other children.
Perhaps I could recommend therapy or a child psychologist.
No, thank you.
We can manage just fine.
Is there some problem in the home?
Are you employed?
That's none of your business, but...
...I am employed, and I'm studying for my master's degree.
Then you are educated.
Are we gonna talk about me or my son?
I'm sorry.
Well, we'll be happy to see Tre back in class on Tuesday.
His suspension was only for three days, you know.
No.
You won't be seeing Tre again.
And why is that, may I ask?
Tre is going to live with his father.
His father?
Yes, his father.
Or did you think we made babies by ourselves?
You tell her go jump in the lake?
What was our agreement?
What did we put down in writing?
"I, Tre Styles, being of sound mind and body...
...agree not to get into any disputes, physical or verbal...
...for the rest of the school year.
If I do not conform to this...
...I will go to live with my father, Mr Furious Styles." "Signed..." Oh, now, who wrote this?
"Tre Styles." You have to work on your handwriting.
Bean pies.
World-famous bean pies.
Like a bean pie, mister?
I just don't want to see you end up dead.
Or in jail.
A drunk, standing in front of one of these liquor stores.
Can you understand?
Look at me.
I'm serious.
I love you.
You're my only son.
How you doing?
I'm fine.
How about yourself N The Hood?
I'm living.
That's enough for me.
Well, here he is.
What's the matter?
You can't say hi?
Hi, Daddy.
Go ahead, talk to your friends.
What's up, Tre?
What's up, Doughboy?
Well, there goes your son.
You wanted him, you got him.
Why you trying to make this so easy?
Well, it's like you told me: I can't teach him how to be a man.
That's your job.
So it ain't no weekly thing no more, huh?
You staying for good?
Chris, you know Tre, right?
Remember, we were playing ball?
Yeah.
You the one collect all those comic books.
You living here now?
Thank you, Reva.
Furious.
Take care of my baby.
He is my baby too.
You still collect comics?
This fool got more comics than a motherfucker.
Tre, come here.
Watch my stuff.
What up, Tre?
What's up, Rick?
Well, it looks like you got all your friends over here.
When you coming to pick me up?
Listen...
...this is just a temporary thing.
When I graduate, I'll get a better job, a better place to stay.
Maybe a house?
Then you can come back, and things will be better.
Okay?
Okay, Mom.
Okay.
Can I have a kiss?
Love you, love you.
Me too.
Bye, Mommy.
Doughboy, staying out of trouble?
I ain't got no troubles.
You got some troubles?
Lawn trouble.
Why don't y'all rake these leaves up?
How much?
I'll give you $5 for the whole lawn.
Five dollars.
Man, that ain't shit.
I can make more doing nothing.
Oh, yeah?
Doing what?
He work for his uncle.
That's too bad.
I guess I just have to get my son to do it for me.
Do what?
Want you to rake up these leaves off the lawn.
Boy, don't look at me funny if I ask you to do something.
Take this.
There's two trash bags right there on the ground.
See y'all later.
Damn, your daddy mean.
He's worse than the bogeyman himself N The Hood.
Gotta do all these leaves.
Who he think you is, Kunta Kinte?
Later, Tre.
Later.
What you mean, a bogeyman?
There ain't no such thing.
Yeah, there is.
Lf there is...
...I'll bet you Hulk could whip his ass.
Yeah, later.
Tre, I gotta lay down the rules of the house.
Same thing as weekends, you remember?
All right, what are they?
Clean the bathroom sink, floor and tub.
I gotta clean that tub?
Yeah.
Clean my room and water the lawn.
Dad, can I ask you something?
What do you have to do around here?
I don't have to do nothing around here except for pay the bills...
...put food on the table and put clothes on your back, you understand?
Glad I don't have to pay no bills.
You may think I'm being hard on you right now, but I'm not.
I'm trying to teach you how to be responsible.
Your friends across the street, they don't have anybody to show them.
You gonna see how they end up too.
I'm glad you're here, Tre.
You're a prince, you know that?
Yeah.
You're the prince...
...I'm the king.
Right now, the king says it's time for the prince to go to bed.
So get yourself N The Hood together.
I'll see you in the morning, okay?
Oh, shit!
Somebody must've prayed for that fool.
I swear I aimed right for his head.
Should've blew it off.
Don't say that.
Don't say that.
It'd be contributing to killing another brother.
Man, where are these fools?
We've been waiting out here for almost an hour.
We got a call of a burglary here.
That was about an hour ago.
We didn't ask you that.
Yeah, well, I told you.
Besides, I don't like having my son out in the cold.
Just tell me what happened, sir.
Somebody broke into the house.
I fired at him with my piece, and he ran away.
You didn't get him?
Lf I did, he'd be laid out here.
Is there anything missing?
No.
Good, no need to make out a report.
Got a 415 on Florence between Vermont and Normandie.
Too bad you didn't get him.
Be one less nigger out here we have to worry about.
Hey, little man, how you doing?
Go on in the house, Tre.
Go on.
Something wrong?
Something wrong?
Yeah.
It's just too bad you don't know what it is...
...brother.
Ice-cream man!
Wait up!
What's up?
You ain't shit.
You just like your daddy.
You don't do shit and you never gonna amount to shit.
All you ever do around here is eat, sleep and shit.
Look at this place.
Way y'all act, y'all must think I'm the maid.
Is that it?
I gotta go.
Hell, no, it ain't it!
It ain't it till I say it's it, damn it!
Cigarette.
Don't get smart with me, I'll knock your ass in the middle of next week.
Where you going, you little fat fuck?
You ain't got a job.
Who's that little fucker on my porch?
Oh, you're Furious'little boy, huh?
Boy, you look more and more like your daddy every day.
So tell me something.
How come he don't play cards with us no more?
I don't know.
I know he don't think he's better than us.
Too busy shooting at people.
I heard what happened there the other night.
He still got that same girlfriend?
Excuse me, Mama.
Why do you always play football?
Because that's what I want to do.
That's right.
I heard Furious shot at somebody last night.
He get him?
No.
Who is that?
That's my lady, homie.
Her name's Brandi.
She ain't your woman.
She's my woman.
How, when she my lady?
She's my wife.
I stick my ding-a-ling in her every night, so that makes her mine.
Get your ass in here and quit looking at them boys!
Punk!
Faggot!
Get off me, with your big 4-by-4 head!
Get off!
Get off!
Man, forget that girl.
Come on, let's go see Chris.
Where's my ball?
Man, don't bring that ball.
Me and my daddy going fishing.
We ain't gonna stay long.
Where's he live?
He don't live far.
Rick, why you have to bring that ball?
I ain't saying nothing if it get took.
Y'all want to see a dead body?
Yeah.
Tre's daddy blasted at somebody last night.
Really?
What kind of gun your daddy got?
I think it's a 357 Magnum.
Really?
I got a deuce-deuce.
My brother gave it to me before he went to jail.
I got it under my bed.
Want to see?
It's loaded too.
It's up in here.
Damn!
It smell like a dog died.
Look like Freddy Krueger got him.
He stink.
That's how they smell after a while.
I wonder why it take them people so long to pick him up.
Yo, man, I ain't going up in there.
Oh, man.
Damn, it's stinky in this motherfucker!
Hey, throw the ball.
You ain't gonna see it again.
Don't you know this is a dead body?
Yeah, I know that shit!
He ain't bothering you, so don't fuck with him!
Throw the ball, little man.
I ain't gonna take it.
Chris, tell him I ain't gonna take his ball.
I got enough money to buy me a hundred balls.
Shit!
Man, I told you not to bring that ball.
Thanks, cuz.
Yo, dog.
Throw the ball.
Shit.
Let's start the game, man.
Man, you stupid!
Don't have no sense.
Told you not to bring that ball.
Wait till I tell Mama.
Man, shut up.
I don't care.
Tell Mama.
Y'all leaving?
Hell, no.
Give me my brother's ball back!
No, no!
Come on, man!
No, don't say nothing.
You're gonna lose, man.
Give me my brother's ball back!
What'd you say, fat boy?
Give me my brother's ball back be...
Before what?
What your fat ass gonna do?
Yo, Rock!
Give the little nigga the ball back.
Stupid motherfucker!
I was gonna give it to you too.
Man!
Hey, man, I got a football.
I never use it myself N The Hood.
I give it to you when we get home.
He ain't gonna want it.
His daddy gave him that ball.
Wish I could kill that motherfucker.
Yo, Rock, give me the ball.
Give me the fucking ball!
Hey!
Hey, little man!
Catch!
Man, you sorry.
I'm going to the store.
Why?
You ain't got no money.
I'm going anyway.
So you a leader or a follower?
I'm a leader.
Okay, then.
What's the three rules?
Break it down for me.
And, hey...
...think before you answer.
I got it!
Always look a person in the eye.
Do that, they respect you better.
Two was to never be afraid to ask you for anything.
Stealing isn't necessary.
And the last one, I think, was...
...to never respect anybody who doesn't respect you back.
That right?
Yeah.
Yeah, you got it.
What do you know about sex?
I know a little bit.
Oh, yeah?
What little bit is that?
I know, I take a girl...
...stick my thing in her...
...and nine months later a baby comes out.
You think that's it?
Basically, yeah.
Well, remember this: Anyone fool with a dick can make a baby, but only a real man can raise his chldren.
I wasn't but 17 when your mother was pregnant with you.
All of my friends was dropping out of high school...
...hanging out in front of liquor stores, getting drunk, getting high.
Some of them was robbing people.
Some of them was even killing people.
Hey, you remember my friend Marcus?
He got into robbing people, wanted me to join him...
...but I said, "No, I'm getting ready to have a son." I knew you'd be a boy.
I wanted to be somebody you could look up to.
So I guess that's why I went to Vietnam.
Don't ever go in the Army, Tre.
Black man ain't got no place in the Army.
Damn!
Why'd you get it all over me?
Don't do that no more, that's nasty.
What?
Oh, wait!
Listen to this song!
I love this song!
{Y:i}Things are gonna get easier {Y:i}Ooh, child Things'll get brighter {Y:i}Ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Oh, damn!
Looks like they going to juvie.
No, man.
They going to the gates.

You don't know what I be getting.
Don't be fucking no dopeheads.
I let them suck my dick, but I don't fuck them.
They got AIDS and shit.
You can catch that shit from letting them suck on your dick too.
Thank you.
But I ain't sick.
I ain't all skinny and shit.
What you mean, you ain't skinny?
Motherfucker's skinny enough to hula-hoop through a Cheerio.
You ain't got to be skinny or sick.
You could die in five years from it.
Mark ass.
Y'all trying to scare me.
Can you really get it from letting them suck it?
Mark.
Tre?
How you doing, baby?
Fine.
Good, you just in time for the food.
I'm bringing out the rest of the things.
Potato salad.
You name it, we got it.
Everybody's here, so have a good time.
Okay.
Oh, and Tre?
Baby, do me a favour.
Talk to Darin for me.
Talk to him seriously, you hear?
I am so sick and tired of him going in and out of there.
Maybe some of what you got will rub off on him.
Okay.
What's up, Dough?
Oh, shit!
What up, G?
Tre, love in effect.
Yo, what's up, Tre?
What's up, Chris?

Working over at the Fox Hills Mall.

You look like you selling rocks.
Tre, you be slinging that shit?
No, I don't be doing that shit.
Couldn't anyway.
Pops'd kick your ass.
You know, I'm out of the pen now.
Trying to keep my ass out this time.
That's what we here to celebrate.
Yeah.
Damn, brother, how did you get so big?
Pumping iron and eating, man.
Nothing else to do in the motherfucking pen.
Three hots and a cot, know what I'm saying?
Rest of the time I was reading and writing my girl.
Reading?
Yeah, motherfucker.
I ain't no criminal.
I can read, bitch.
Who is that, Shanice?
That's Tre, Ricky's best friend.
He was best friends with Doughboy when they was little.
They be trying to act like they brothers.
Girl, he is fine!
I'd like to rush that!
He go to Washington?
He go to Crenshaw.
I seen him before.
He work at the Fox Hills Mall.
Do he got a girlfriend?
Yes.
Jamaica, girl, I was scoping on this ho's man.
He fine, anyway.
You better watch his ass.
Somebody might steal him.
All right, y'all, come and get it!
Do you live here?
Okay, girl.
Sorry-ass niggas.
Come on.
Why don't y'all act like gentlemen and let these ladies eat first!
Yeah, you act like you ain't never had no barbecue before.
Let the ladies eat.
Hos gotta eat too.
Wait, nigga, who you calling a ho?
I ain't no ho.
Oops.
I'm sorry, bitch.
Hey, hey, watch your mouth.
Just playing.
All right, enjoy.
And be nice.
Get out of the way!
You still up here?
Hi.
Hello.
So why haven't you called?
Just one minute.
What's up, my brother?
She wants to talk to you.
I know.
I'm just taking my time.
Oh, I see.
You trying to run that game on her.
Yeah, how am I doing?
Well, you're doing just fine.
Except for one thing.
Yeah, what's that?
She left.
What?
Damn!
That's all right.
Hey, hey, hey.
Ain't this a bitch?
Wait!
Wait!
Don't worry about it.
I got her.
Is she all right?
All right, G.
Sheryl!
Come on!
Keep your baby out the street.
She gonna get hit one of these days.
You got some blow?
You got some rock?
I'll suck your dick.
Just keep the baby off the streets.
And change her diapers.
Girl almost smell as bad as you.
What up, punk?
What up, fool?
Mark.
What is that?
Barbecue?
Yeah.
I know you didn't bring me no swine.
No.
Mrs Baker told me to bring you a plate.
Brenda, huh?
Yeah.
She might've had a chance if she didn't talk so much.
Let's see.
She ain't lost her touch.
She still can make some barbecue.
Hey, Pop, can you fix my fade back here?
And up here?
I'm eating.
After you eat.
Yeah.
Yeah, real close.
So I can brush it, you know, hook up some waves.
Something wrong?
Nope.
What's the problem?
You're getting old, Pop.
I'm getting old?
Yeah.
I'm getting better, young brother.
You getting old.
You older than dirt.
I'm older than dirt?
Yes.
I am but 17 years older than you.
Your friends, they got fathers in their 40s and 50s.
These cats are great big...
Just slobs, man.
You know, bellies out to here.
Yes.
That's gonna be you!
That's gonna be you, man.
Big old fat, juicy roll...
...double-jelly-roll belly.
Right?
Sitting in a rocking chair, reading the funny papers!
Then your grandchildren will be running around, saying: "Granddaddy, give me something.
Give me a dollar." You think so, huh?
Yeah.
Wait a minute, man.
What's all this about grandkids, man?
You using the rubbers I gave you?
I ain't ready to be a granddaddy, all right?
I just...
I ain't ready for all of that.
Don't worry.
I can take care of myself N The Hood.
Why are you sweating me, man?
Tre, close the refrigerator.
Close it.
Come here.
What?
All right?
What?
I stink now?
I got something on me?
You had some pussy yet?
What?
You had some pussy yet?
Yeah!
Yeah!
When?
What?
When?
All right, all right.
Just sit down for a second.
Go on, sit down, now.
It was a Sunday, right?
Rick and I were kicking it up on Crenshaw.
This group of females rolled up in a Rabbit.
Everybody trying to bum-rush them.
Trying to jib and all, right?
Man, there was this one girl everybody was trying to rush.
Baby was fine!
Body was booming, like right out of Jet centerfold.
So I'm, like, eyeballing her.
She walks right up on me and busts out, "Is this your ride?" Then I say, "Yeah, you want to go for a ride with me?" She says, "No, I want to drive it." I say, "Can you drive stick?" She says, "I can learn if you teach me." I go into my mack-daddy mode because I'm getting a woody in my sweats.
I says, "Why don't you give me your number, I'll call you for a lesson." She does.
About a week later, I'm over at her house.
Her mom and grandma are leaving for church.
I walk right up to the door, man.
As soon as I go inside, boom!
We go at it, nonstop.
Kissing, hugging, right?
So I pick her up, take her upstairs.
Well, about 20 minutes into it, Mom and Grandma's come home.
Seems Grandma forgot her purse.
Wanted to make sure she has something to put in the collection plate.
Yeah, I guess she could smell the sex in the air or something, right?
She starts straight towards Tisha's room.
That's the last I ever saw of Tisha.
I call her once in a while...
...but when I do, her mom or grandma say, "She can't talk right now.
She busy, doing the dishes." What'd you use?
I used the number she gave me.
Why are you sweating me?
I had to use nothing.
She said she was on the pill.
How many times I tell you?
If a girl's on the pill...
...you use something anyway.
A pill ain't gonna keep your dick from falling off.
I don't know why you insist on learning things the hard way...
...but you gonna learn.
Oh, yeah, you gonna learn!
Clean up that hair.
What's up, man?
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
What?
You slamming my door like some gorilla on a football field!
Damn, nigga, what's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Guess what, man?
Recruiter from SC's coming tonight.
Cool.
You know, man, I never lied to my father.
Never?
Well, almost never.
Where's all this coming from?
Where's all this coming from?
I lied to Pops yesterday.
Told him I weren't no virgin.
Well, you ain't a virgin, is you?
Is you?
Well, technically speaking, I haven't.
You know, I fingered a couple of honeys...
...and sucked on some titties, but I ain't never stuck it in.
Why not, man?
You really want to know?
Yeah, I asked you, didn't I?
I was afraid.
Shit!
Get off me.
See, man?
Shut up.
Shut up.
What you doing, man?
What you afraid of, man?
Of being a daddy.
Oh.
Well, yeah.
But I'm getting old now, see?
And now that I want to slap some skins, Brandi ain't even down for it.
Even with a jimmy she ain't down.
Is that right?
I don't see that.
Why the silent treatment?
You haven't talked to me in five days!
You tell your father to say you're not home.
Then you take the phone off the hook!
Well, I been busy.
Oh, well, don't give me no bald-ass excuse for a lie like that!
What did I do that was so bad that you just had to stop talking to me?
See, you know what you did.
See, you gotta get with the program.
I told you about that.
I'm Catholic, and it goes against my morals.
Yeah, but Catholic girls are supposed to be one of the biggest hootchies.
When you bust a cap on somebody?
I bust a cap like, blam-blam.
Damn!
God!
Come on, fuck him up, man!
Fuck him up!
You say you want to wait till you get married first, right?
No, look at me.
Right?
Yeah.
And I say that I'm gonna be the one who marries you.
So it don't make no difference when we do it...
...we still gonna get married, right?
Yeah, but I'm going to college before I marry...
...and there ain't no guarantee that I'm gonna marry you!
Bad shit!
Hey, hey, yo.
Yo, bonita.
Damn, look at that ass.
Chica bonita.
You come to my casa and let's do the loco thing.
Hey, Dooky, this fool trying to speak Spanish...
That shit worked.
What up, baby?
So let me knock the stuffing off that Egg McMuffin.
You got a phone number?
You haven't even given me a ring!
I ain't ready for all that yet!
But you're ready to act like we are, though?
What your man say?
Don't touch me.
All right.
You make me sick, man.
I know, but I missed you.
I missed you too.
I missed you too.
He still ain't fucked her yet.
You better take your ass to the store with that.
So you gonna give me the skins or what?
No, that's not all I think about.
Yeah.
Okay.
Pop!
Yo!
Brandi's mom say you're cute!
Ask her how come she don't say hi when I speak to her.
He say, "How come she don't say hi when he speak to her?" Yeah.
Hey, I'm supposed to be talking to you, not passing messages.
If my daddy mess with your mama, we gonna be brother and sister.
Then we have to do that incest thing.
What?
No, no, I'm just kidding.
Wait, hang on, I got another call.
Who this?
Oh, hi, Mama.
Yeah.
Hang on, I got Brandi on the other line, okay?
So you gonna give me the skins or what?
Tre, this is your mother.
I'm sorry, Mama.
Hang on for one second.
Okay.
Brandi?
Yeah, I'm gonna call you back.
Okay.
Hi, Mama.
"Who this"?
What kind of way is that to answer the phone?
I'm sorry, Mama.
Why didn't you come by this weekend?
I was cooling with Rick.
You can cool with your friends anytime.
The weekends are supposed to be our time together.
Have you thought about what we talked about?
Yeah.
And?
I don't know yet.
Let me speak to your daddy.
Pop!
Telephone!
Who this?
Hey, how you doing?
Yeah.
Yeah, we talked about that.
Yeah, well, look...
I know you don't agree with me, but I think it's his decision.
Look, I don't...
No, I don't think that's necessary.
Look, Reva.
Reva, this is bullshit.
I'm sorry, but I think it's ridiculous.
There's no reason for him to come live with you now.
He's not a baby!
No, no, wait a minute.
Why you got an attitude?
I don't have an attitude.
You have an attitude!
We have gone through this a thousand times.
I always tell him...
...use a rubber!
You know, use a rubber...
Watch me shoot this motherfucker.
Look.
Yeah.
Taken off the motherfucking set.
Hey, yo, Monster, man.
Don't be cussing so motherfucking loud.
My moms don't like that shit.
Come on, man, move the plastic.
You're sitting on the good part.
Damn!
Darin?
See, now I gotta hear this shit.
Darin!
What?
Get them drive-by shooters out of...
Damn!
Moms be fucking with his ass without fail.
She ain't like that with Rick, though.
Because they got different daddies.
Y'all got to get the fuck out.
My brother got company in a minute.
See that?
I didn't get my turn.
It's Monster's fault.
Come on, man.
Fix that shit, man.
What up, man?
What up, dude?
Who that?
Anybody know where Ricky Baker lives?
That's my brother!
He live here.
Hey, yo, Rick!
The man here to see you!
Stop.
Stop.
Hold still.
Be still.
There, I got it.
Yo, Rick!
Get your ass out of there.
Ricky, come on out of the bathroom, baby.
Check this out.
Here come the reverend.
So what college you from?
I'm from USC.
You got to have a scholarship to go to SC?
No, but it helps.
Can you hook me up with a scholarship?
What do you do?
I used to play baseball.
Shut up, man.
Don't you know the man's about business?
Move, nigga.
Move, punk.
Move.
Y'all be the fuck quiet.
Hello.
I'm Lewis Crump.
You must be Ricky's mother.
Brenda.
And this is my other son, Darin.
Hello, Darin.
What's up?
Can I get you something to drink?
Coffee, water, soda?
No, thank you.
We met at the game against Washington.
I remember.
That was a good game.
You picked up 276 yards in that game.
That's impressive.
Thanks.
Well, why don't y'all sit and talk?
Hey!
I want you to know we're interested in you coming to the campus.
Get a good look around, you know, a feel for the school as a whole.
Here's my tape.
That was against Banning my junior year.
Man, we lost that year, but I did pretty well in yardage.
They had the best defence in the city that year.
Big country booty!
Big country titties!
Boo-ya!
That's what I'm saying.
From eating all that corn bread and shit, I guess.
Shit.
Me, I go to college just for the hos.
You don't go there to talk to bitches.
You're supposed to be learning something.
Can't learn shit, talking to no stupid-ass bitch.
Yo, check out that 808.
Damn, that shit bumping.
What are you interested in beside playing ball?
Like, what you mean?
I mean...
...what do you want to major in?
What kind of degree would you pursue?
I'm just asking because there's a strong possibility...
...that you won't go into the NFL after college.
Just a fact.
It happens.
Yeah, I heard that before.
Actually, I was thinking about majoring in business.
I got this friend, Tre, who's always talked about going into business.
Plus, I like computers.
Maybe I could do that.
What do you think?
Young brother, I think you can do anything you put your mind to.
I tell you where y'all need to go.
Where they got more women than anywhere.
Fine ones too.
Crenshaw on Sunday nights.
No.
Street races on Florence?
No, nigga.
Y'all way off.
I give y'all a hint.
Everybody's been there.
Where?
Where, nigga?
Spit it out!
The church.
Oh, shit!
Nigga, please!
Ain't nobody going to church to catch no bitches.
I should roll your ass up off this porch for that stupid shit.
So basically you have a 2.3 overall GPA...
...according to the classes we require.
All you have to do is take the SAT test.
Yeah.
I heard about that test.
The next one's being offered, let's see...
...early October.
Are you gonna take it?
I guess so.
I can't get into college without it, right?
Just remember, all you have to do is get over a 700.
Okay.
Come here.
Come here!
I'm sorry, I'm trying to give him a bath.
Come here.
Your little brother?
No, that's my son.
Well, I'll look forward to talking to you again.
We'll also arrange that tour for you.
Thank you, Mr Crump.
You bet, Ricky.
Bye-bye.
You gonna give me a scholarship?
Because I want to go to college too.
Man, shut the fuck up.
Fuck you, nigga.
It's my porch.
You can take your dumb ass home.
My baby is going to a university.
I always knew you would amount to something.
I did.
When you were little, you used to always run around with that football.
I'm proud of you, baby.
Thanks, Mama.
You make your mama proud.
May I have your attention?
The SAT test will be administered in this room.
When you receive your test book, please keep it closed on your desk.
Read the directions on the front cover of your test book.
Use a number two pencil in marking your answer sheet.
Ink or ballpoint pen is not to be used.
If you do not have a number two pencil with you...
...raise your hand and keep it up.
We'll pass a pencil out to you.
During the time allotted for a section, you may work on that section only.
If you finish a section before time is called...
...you may not go back to a previous section or on to the next one.
You have 30 minutes for section one.
Open your test books and begin work.
This it?
Yeah.
Damn!
Baby got more cakes than Duncan Hines!
Damn.
Bet you buy the chip.
Don't worry, the interest rate hasn't moved two percent in five years.
"Furious Styles Financial." Talk to you later.
So how you guys think you did on the test?
All right, I guess.
Those tests are culturally biased.
The only universal part is the math.
You boys must be hungry.
I'm real surprised to see you.
Came to see you.
See how you doing.
How's business going?
Well, there's always business, just not always in here.
What do you do, Furious?
You help people get money for homes or what?
Well, there is no "or what." That's what I do, Rick.
You boys want to see something?
Do we have a choice?
No.
I don't know about all this.
Got us walking around Compton and all.
Rick, it's the '90s.
We can't afford to be afraid of our own people anymore.
Would you two knuckleheads come on?
I want y'all to look at that sign.
See what it says?
"Cash for your home." You know what that is?
It's a billboard.
Billboard.
What are y'all, Amos and Andy?
Are you Steppin'and he's Fetchit?
I'm talking about the message.
What it stands for.
It's called "gentrification." It's what happens when property value of a certain area is brought down.
You listening?
Yeah.
They bring the property value down.
They can buy the land cheaper.
Then they move the people out, raise the value and sell it at a profit.
What we need to do is keep everything in our neighbourhood, everything, black.
Black-owned with black money.
Just like the Jews, the Italians, the Mexicans and the Koreans do.
Ain't nobody from outside bringing down the property value.
It's these folk!
Shooting each other and selling that crack rock and shit.
How you think crack gets into the country?
We don't own any planes.
We don't own no ships.
We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
Every time you turn on a TV, that's what you see.
Black people selling the rock, pushing the rock.
Yeah, I know.
It wasn't a problem when it was here.
Wasn't a problem until it was in Iowa...
...and on Wall Street where there's hardly any black people.
If you want to talk about guns...
...why is it that there's a gun shop on every corner here?
Why?
I'll tell you why.
Just like there's a liquor store on every corner in the black community.
Why?
They want us to kill ourselves.
You go out to Beverly Hills, you don't see that shit.
They want to us to kill ourselves.
The best way to destroy a people is to take away their ability to reproduce.
Who is it that's dying out here on these streets every night?
Y'all.
Yeah.
Young brothers like yourselves.
What am I supposed to do?
Fool roll up, try to smoke me?
I'm gonna shoot the motherfucker if he don't kill me first.
You doing exactly what they want you to do.
You have to think, young brother, about your future.
Damn, man.
You know, Furious is deep.
He used to be a preacher?
He ain't never been no preacher.
Just reads a lot.
My brother should've heard that, man.
Would've done him some good.
Where he at?
Where else, man?
Up on Crenshaw with the rest of them fools.
Let's go.
Cool.
What up, Monster?
What up, nigga?
Goddamn, there's a lot of fuckers here.
Don't be using God's name in vain.
What?
Man, shut up.
Yo, man, you believe in God?
Yo, why the fuck y'all get so damn religi-fied lately?
Fool, I wasn't even talking to you.
This is an A and B conversation.
You can see your way out of it.
You can see your way out of my ride...
...and we'll see your crippled ass walking home.
Man, look.
Do I believe in God?
Yeah, I guess I do.
How else can you have the sun, moon and stars and shit like that?
Sun, moon, stars, quasars.
Motherfucker sound like Elroy Jetson.
There ain't no God.
If there was a God, why He be letting motherfuckers get smoked every night?
Babies and little kids, tell me that.
You tell me this, nigga.
How you know God's a He?
He could be a She.
You don't know that.
For one thing, you don't know what the fuck I be motherfucking knowing.
I read about this shit when I was in the pen.
It was this book, right, and it was telling...
...life in the perspective if God was a bitch.
Said if God was a bitch, there wouldn't be no nuclear bombs, no wars...
...because that ain't in a bitch's nature.
Why every time you talk about a female you say bitch or whore or hootchie?
Because that's what you are.
Nigga, fuck you.
Hey, hey.
What's up?
What up, D?
What's up, Mon?
What's up, man?
Hey, Tre.
What's happening?
Where y'all coming from?
Compton.
What y'all doing over here, man?
We're kicking it.
Philosophizing on God, church, bitches and all.
I'm schooling these niggas on the aspect of religion.
Religion?
And on factual, actual studies.
You know what I'm saying?
Y'all coming from Compton?
Yeah.
I thought you were scared of Compton.
Rick was a shivering bitch, boy.
It was deep, though.
You should've been there, man.
Pops was talking, speaking, man.
Speaking the truth and shit.
Your pops is like motherfucking Malcolm Farrakhan.
Man, what's wrong with you?
Fuck you looking at, nigga?
I'm still trying to find out, nigga!
We got a problem here?
We got a problem here?
We got a problem, nigga?
What up with this?
Put the gun away.
Can't we have one night where nobody gets shot?
Shut up, bitch.
Bitch, I'm gonna fuck you up!
Let's get that bitch!
Fuck you like that.
Ferris always trying to start some shit.
Nigga can't fight, so he always trying to find some excuse to shoot somebody.
That's why fool be getting shot all the time.
Trying to show how hard they is.
Ignorant.
Fool, shut up.
You be doing that shit too.
I know.
Hey, man, come on.
Let's go!
I'm getting the fuck out of L.A.
Fuck this shit.
Fuck it.
You can't go nowhere without it getting all shot up and shit.
Shit!
Shit!
Fuck!
Driver!
Put your hands on the steering wheel!
Got any drugs or weapons on you?
No.
I didn't do nothing.
You think you tough.
You think you're tough, huh?
You scared now, huh?
I like that.
That's why I took this job.
I hate little motherfuckers like you.
Little niggers, you ain't shit!
Think you tough, huh?
I could blow your head off, and you couldn't do shit.
How you feel now?
What set you from?
Look like one of them Crenshaw Mafia motherfuckers.
No, you probably one of them Rolling 60s, huh?
12-Adam-63, we have a possible 187 in blue WW...
...at corner of Florence and Vermont.
Again, a possible 187 in blue WW at corner of Florence and Vermont.
Stay out of trouble.
You gentlemen have a nice evening now, you hear?
Hi.
I thought something happened to you.
Ain't nothing gonna happen to me.
I'm tired of hearing them shooting all the time.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm tired of this shit.
Those two motherfuckers.
I could kill all these motherfuckers.
I'm sick and fucking tired of this shit!
I'm fucking sick of this shit!
I'm so fucking tired of this shit!
Fuck this shit!
Stupid motherfucker!
Fucking fuck you!
Fuck you!
I wish I could kill all you!
Come on at me, motherfucker!
What's so funny?
I never thought I'd be crying in front of a female.
You can cry in front of me.
What do you think about...
...people getting married while they're still in college?
Are you trying to ask me something?
No.
I just wanted to know what you thought about that kind of situation.
I think it can be good if two people really love each other.
Really?
Yeah.
You sure you're down for this?
Yeah.
Are you?
Yeah.
I mean, yes, I am.
I don't want to get pregnant.
You won't.
Hi.
I'm looking for a Miss Devereaux?
She's right over there.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hi.
You look nice.
Thank you.
So do you.
Thanks.
Thanks for coming.
So...
So this is...
...definitely you.
And what's that supposed to mean?
I thought we were gonna talk about Tre.
Espresso, please.
Café au lait, please.
I bought him some shoes yesterday.
Why are you always buying him stuff?
Can't I be nice to my son?
Do I have that right?
Yes, but he has a job.
You don't have to always buy him stuff.
Look...
...did he tell you he wants to move in with Brandi?
Yeah.
So?
"Yeah.
So"?
So don't you think that's a bad idea?
I think that Tre is old enough to make his own decisions, Reva.
You're his father.
That means you were supposed to guide his decisions.
What have I been doing for the last seven years?
Not that, evidently.
Listen, Reva...
...it's time for you to let go.
I know you want to play the mommy...
...but Tre is a grown man now.
He's not a little boy anymore.
That time has passed, sweetheart.
You missed it.
Excuse me, I'm getting some cigarettes.
You're not getting off that easy.
Sit your ass down.
Excuse me?
I said sit down before I raise my voice and make a fool out of both of us.
Okay.
Now it's my time to talk.
Of course you took in your son, my son...
...our son...
...and you taught him to be a man.
I'll give you that...
...because most men ain't man enough to do what you did.
But that gives you no reason, do you hear me, no reason...
...to tell me that I can't be a mother to my son.
What you did...
...is no different from what mothers have done from the beginning of time.
It's just too bad more brothers won't do the same.
But don't think you're special.
You may be cute, but not special.
Drink your café au lait.
It's on me.
Everybody in the mall was running.
Bitches running out of Contempo's.
Fuckers throwing cookies out the cookie shop.
Niggas was getting their bail on.
I was smoking every fucker that came in.
I thought I'd let y'all know that.
Understands me?
What's up?
You missing all the action.
Niggas getting smoked and shit.
Who's them niggas?
Man, pick Chris up.
Punk might start trippin'.
That's those fools from Crenshaw.
Damn, I ain't even got my gat.
Motherfucker ain't got nothing better to do.
Twenty-seven years old.
Still fucking motherfuckers our age...
...with his old ass.
What's up?
Anyway...
...I saw you roll out of Brandi crib at 2 in the motherfucking morning.
Yo, man, that's my business.
Handle your shit, G.
Peer pressure, man.
Handle your shit.
Don't be like this motherfucker.
This motherfucker got babies, in-house pussy.
Let me do shit like that, Ma would be like: "I ain't having it." Ricky.
Ricky!
You know you heard me.
Huh?
What?
I need you to go get some cornmeal.
Yeah.
I'll go in a little while.
If you want to land a good job, you have to know what most employers want.
Like how to motivate yourself N The Hood.
How to lead others.
How to perform under pressure.
You can learn these things in the Army.
No matter what career you choose...
...you'll really be ready to take off.
Ricky, get up and go now.
I can't finish frying the fish without it.
Boy, go get this girl some cornmeal.
You ought to be happy somebody's cooking for your ass.
Give me some, Dook.
Here, take it.
What's up?
What's happening?
D, go to the store for me and get some cornmeal?
Nigga, I ain't the one she told to go get it.
She's your wife.
She ain't my wife, man.
Shit.
Might as well be, y'all got a family and shit.
Tecmo Bowl-playing motherfucker.
Fuck you, man.
Go to the store with me.
Sure, let's do it.
What?
Don't fuck me, fuck your wife.
That's why you got a baby.
You better get out of my face, all right?
What's up with Brandi?
Hey, you a punk, man!
Hey, yo, yo.
Wait a minute.
Wait!
This is family business.
Let 'em fight.
Y'all are brothers!
You ain't supposed to be fighting.
You been a punk from day one.
Mama's boy!
Get him, Dough.
Let 'em fight, man.
Brenda, Ricky and Doughboy are out here fighting.
Cut that out.
Get off of him.
Get off of him!
Damn.
What you hit me for?
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm all right!
What you hit me for?
It's the test scores.
Ricky!
Ricky, baby, your test scores!
What you hit me for?
Why you hitting me?
Yo, Dough.
Why she hit you?
Shut up, man.
Fuck all that shit.
I'm going into the fucking Army.
That's all there is to say.
You're doing what?
Man, what are you, a damn fool?
They say I can learn to work on computers.
Plus, they'll give me money for college.
Listen to you.
You sound like the commercial.
They don't tell you that you don't belong to you no more.
You belong to them, the government.
Like a slave or something.
My daddy told me a black man...
...has got no business, no place in the white man's Army.
I heard all that.
I got a little boy to think about, okay?
I don't want to be like my brother.
Hanging out and not doing shit.
End up dealing 'caine, just like him.
I want to do something with my life.
I want to be somebody.
Listen, let me tell you something.
When you join that Army, you ain't gonna be nobody.
Yo, you got any change?
No, I ain't got no change.
See?
What up?
Yo, chief.
Here you go.
Hey, no problem, bro.
You win anything?
Wait a minute, man.
I'm still trying to find out.
Shit.
Nothing.
What?
I said nothing.
I didn't win.
You gotta be Mexican to win that shit.
Man, I win this lottery, I won't have to worry about a damn thing.
Don't have to worry about no colleges, no 700 on no SATs.
Not a damn...
Look.
There's that motherfucker from the other night.
Okay.
When I say "cut," we'll cut through these houses.
Cut!
Punk ass.
Get him, man, get him!
Let's get him.
Go around the corner.
Cut 'em off.
Come on, go!
Shit.
Fucking mangy mutts!
Come on.
I got you.
I got you.
Come on, let's go.
Hold on, man.
What are you doing?
I gotta drain the weasel.
If that motherfucker roll up on the set one more time, I'll blast his ass.
Shit!
Rick!
What a relief and shit.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
Let's split up.
I don't think we should do that.
I think it'd be better if we're together.
Them fools ain't gonna do nothing.
They just showing out and shit.
I'll meet you at your house.
Cool.
I'm out of here.
Come on, man.
Ricky!
Ricky.
Help me!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Ricky!
Shit!
Watch his head.
Don't hurt him.
Don't hurt him, man.
Be careful with him.
Watch his head.
He's dead.
Let's take him home.
Mama!
Mama!
Mama!
No!
Ricky!
Oh, my God, no!
Not Ricky!
What y'all doing now?
Ricky?
Oh, my God.
Ricky?
Ricky, baby, get up.
Get up.
Wake up, baby.
Ricky, get up.
Get up.
It's all right.
Get up, baby.
Get up.
Tre, what happened?
What happened to him?
Give me the baby.
Give me the baby!
Don't touch him!
Don't you ever touch him!
He don't need to be seeing this!
Ricky, please wake up!
Mom.
What did you do?
What did you do?
It wasn't my fault.
What did you do?
Mama, I didn't do nothing.
Oh, my God!
What did you do to him?
What did you do?
What did you do?
You did this!
You did this!
I'll kill you!
You did it!
I know you did it!
You did it!
Yes, you did!
I told you!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!
Ricky, baby!
Ricky!
Meet me at my house in five minutes.
Tre, what happened?
Talk to me.
What happened?
Go home.
What happened to Ricky?
Go home.
Talk to him.
Something happened to Rick!
I don't know.
He just got shot.
Something happened to Rick!
Brandi, I want you to calm down and I want you to go home.
You hear me?
You hear me?
Yes.
I'll take care of him.
He'll be all right.
Tre, what are you doing?
Oh, you bad, now, huh?
You bad.
You gotta shoot somebody now, huh?
Well, here I am.
Come on, shoot me.
You bad, right?
Look, I'm sorry about your friend.
My heart goes out to his family, but that's their problem.
You my son.
You my problem.
I want you to give me the gun.
I see.
You want to end up like little Chris in a wheelchair?
Right?
No, no, you want to end up like Doughboy, huh?
No?
Give me the motherfucking gun, Tre!
You're my only son, and I'm not gonna lose you to no bullshit, you hear?
I love you, man.
Go clean yourself N The Hood up.
Go on.
Tre.
Tre!
Damn.
Shit!
Yeah.
Let me out.
Dough...
...let me out.
Where these motherfuckers at, man?
Been out here damn near three hours.
It's colder than a motherfucker out here too.
Let's go eat.
Cool.
When you gonna get your hair cut?
It look like something from 1983.
Ain't nobody cutting my hair.
I'm like Samson.
My strength is in my head.
What's up with the babe you been talking to?
Fuck that bitch.
You scared?
He ain't scared, he just young.
And dumb.
I'm putting ketchup on this.
Why you put all that ketchup on it?
Why you worried about it, fool?
These my fries.
We going to see your girl?
No, I'm going to see my girl.
You going home.
There they go, right there.
Turn off the lights.
Hit the lights, nigga.
Take your ass home and watch some videos.
Home with your mama.
Check that motherfucker out.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Don't follow me.
Go your own way.
What the fuck?
What the fuck you doing?
This motherfucker's crazy!
Goddamn, man.
And I'm on parole.
Ain't this about a bitch!
What the fuck you doing?
Shit!
Yo, Dough.
Let's bail, man.
Let's go, man!
Come on, nigga, now!
Man, what the fuck?
Oh, shit!
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's go, man.
Let's go!
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!
Turn your punk ass over.
I didn't do it, man.
I didn't pull the fucking trigger.
What the fuck you doing?
Come on, man.
Well, fuck you!
Dough, let's bail, man.
Man, let's move!
Let's go!
What the fuck you doing?
Let's bail, man!
Let's go, man!
Come on, nigga, let's bail!
Damn!
Come on!
Shit, let's get out of here.
Here come the fucking police.
Get your ass in.
What's up?
What's up?
Yo, cuz.
I know why you got out of the car last night.
You shouldn't have been there in the first place.
You don't want that shit to come back to haunt you.
I ain't been up this early in a long time.
Turned on the TV this morning.
Had this shit on about...
...how we're living in a violent world.
Showed all these foreign places.
How foreigners live and all.
I started thinking, man.
Either they don't know...
...don't show...
...or don't care about what's going on in the 'hood.
They had all this foreign shit.
They didn't have shit on my brother, man.
I ain't got no brother.
Got no mother, neither.
She loved that fool more than she love me.
Doughboy.
You got some blow?
Got some rock?
Get the fuck out of my face!
Keep them goddamn babies out the street.
Did y'all get 'em?
I don't even know how I feel about it neither, man.
Shit just goes on and on, you know.
Next thing you know, somebody might try to smoke me.
Don't matter, though.
We all gotta go sometime, huh?
Seem like they punched the wrong clock on Rick, though.
Yeah.
I gotta go, cuz.
Hey, Dough.
What's up?
You still got one brother left, man.
Thanks, man.
Later, G.
[<pre><font face="Franklin Gothic Demi"> What the fuck is that?
Jimmy?
What's up?
Did I hit something?
What the fuck is that?
Maybe you got a flat.
What the fuck?
Pull over.
He's still alive.
You piece of shit!
Die, you motherfucker!
Look at me!
As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.
To me...
...being a gangster was better than being president of the United States.
Even before I went to the cabstand for an after-school job...
...I knew I wanted to be a part of them.
It was there that I knew I belonged.
To me, it meant being somebody...
...in a neighborhood full of nobodies.
They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.
They parked in front of hydrants and never got a ticket.
When they played cards all night...
...nobody ever called the cops.
Tony Stacks.
How are you?
Tuddy Cicero.
Could this be the Canarsie kid?
Tuddy.
Tuddy ran the cabstand and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...
...and other places for his brother Paul, who was the boss of the neighborhood.
Paulie might have moved slow...
...but it was only because Paulie didn't have to move for anybody.
It's your fault.
Yeah, it's your fault.
At first my parents loved that I found a job across the street from the house.
My father, who was Irish, was sent to work at the age of .
He liked that I got myself a job.
He always used to say that American kids were spoiled lazy.
Henry!
Watch how you cross!
Bring back milk!
My mother was happy after she found out the Ciceros...
...came from the same part of Sicily as she did.
To my mother...
...that was the answer to her prayers.
I was the luckiest kid in the world.
I could go anywhere, do anything.
I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.
Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy would let me park their Cadillacs.
Here I am, this little kid, I can't even see over the steering wheel...
...and I'm parking Cadillacs.
But, it wasn't too long...
...before my parents changed their minds about my job at the cabstand.
For them, it was supposed to be a part-time job.
But for me...
...it was definitely full time.
That's all I wanted to do.
People like my father could never understand, but I was part of something.
I belonged.
I was treated like a grown-up.
Tell him .
Every day I was learning to score.
A dollar here, a dollar there.
I was living in a fantasy.
Have a good day at school?
My father was always pissed off.
Pissed that he made such lousy money, that my brother...
...was in a wheelchair.
He was pissed that seven of us lived in such a tiny house.
Tell me about this.
A letter from school.
It says you haven't been there in months.
Months!
You're a bum!
Want to grow up to be a bum?!
After a while, he was mostly pissed because I hung around the cabstand.
He knew what went on there.
Every once in a while I'd have to take a beating.
But by then, I didn't care.
The way I saw it...
...everybody takes a beating sometime.
I can't make any more deliveries.
You'll fuck everything up.
My dad says he'll kill me.
Look.
Come with me.
Is that him there?
How about him?
That's him.
Get him.
Excuse me.
Scumbag.
Come here, you piece of shit.
Know this kid?
Know where he lives?
You deliver mail to his house?
From now on, any letter from school to his house comes directly here.
Understand?
Another letter from school goes to that kid's house...
...in the oven you'll go, head first.
That was it.
No more letters from truant officers.
No letters from school.
In fact, no more letters from anybody.
After a few weeks, my mother went to the post office to complain.
How could I go to school after that...
...and pledge allegiance and sit through good government bullshit?
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.
Mickey called.
Call him back.
He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back.
Got a nickel?
Get him on the phone.
There were guys, that's all they did all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.
For a guy who moved all day long...
...Paulie didn't talk to people.
With union problems...
...or a beef in the numbers...
...only the top guys spoke with Paulie about the problem.
Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.
He didn't want anyone hearing what he said...
...or anyone listening to what he was being told.
Hundreds of guys depended on him, and he got a piece of everything they made.
It was a tribute, like in the old country, except they were doing it in America.
All they got from Paulie was protection from the guys trying to rip them off.
That's what it's all about.
That's what the FBI could never understand.
What Paulie and the organization does...
...is protect people who can't go to the cops.
That's it.
They're like the police department for wiseguys.
People looked at me differently, and they knew I was with somebody.
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday morning for fresh bread.
The owner knew who I was with and no matter how many people were waiting...
...I was taken care of first.
Our neighbors stopped parking in our driveway, even though we had no car.
At ...
...I was making more money than most of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.
I had it all.
One day...
One day, some neighborhood kids carried my mother's groceries all the way home.
Know why?
It was out of respect.
What do you think?
Aren't my shoes great?
You look like a gangster.
They shot me.
Help!
Henry, shut the door.
That was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Can't have that in here.
Jesus Christ!
I can't have that in this joint.
I remember feeling bad about the guy, but also...
...feeling maybe Tuddy was right.
I knew Paulie didn't want anyone dying in the building.
You're a real jerk.
You wasted fucking aprons on this guy.
What's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.
It was a glorious time.
And wiseguys were all over the place.
It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joe...
...decided to take on a boss and start a war.
It was when I met the world.
And it was when I first met Jimmy Conway.
He couldn't have been more than or at the time, but he was already a legend.
He'd just walk in and everybody who worked the room went wild.
He'd give a doorman $ for opening the door.
He'd give hundreds to the dealers and guys who ran the games.
The bartender got $ for keeping ice cubes cold.
The Irishman is here to take you Guineas'money.
Want a drink?
Give me a and .
Meet the kid Henry.
Keep them coming.
Jimmy was one of the most feared guys in the city.
He was first locked up at and doing hits for mob bosses at .
Hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.
But what Jimmy really loved to do, what he really loved to do was steal.
He actually enjoyed it.
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in movies.
Give me your wallet.
You might know who we are, but we know who you are.
He was one of the biggest highjackers...
...of booze, cigarettes, razor blades, shrimp and lobsters.
Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went fast.
Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.
They called him Jimmy the Gent.
Help the lady.
Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...
...about the really good loads, of course, everybody got a piece.
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.
Henry, come here.
Meet Tommy.
Youse gonna be working together, okay?
Good.
Jimmy, you get anything good?
And when the cops assigned a whole army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?
He made them partners.
I'd complain, but who'd listen?
What do you need?
Two Luckys.
What are you doing?
It's all right.
Who says?
Your mother?
How many you need?
Where'd you get the cigarettes?
Get him out of here.
It's okay.
It's not okay!
You don't understand.
You don't understand.
Store's closed.
Henry got pinched.
Where?
By the factory.
Henry Hill.
The People of the State of New York vs.
Henry Hill.
Docket # .
Yes, sir.
That's me.
Just stand there.
Now stay there.
Proceed.
Congratulations.
A graduation present.
Why?
I got pinched.
Everyone does.
You did it right.
You told them nothing.
I thought you'd be mad.
I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.
You took your first pinch like a man, and learned the two greatest things in life.
Look at me.
Never rat on your friends...
...and always keep your mouth shut.
Here he is!
You broke your cherry!
Congratulations!
By the time I grew up, there was billion a year in cargo...
...moving through Idlewild Airport, and we tried to steal every bit of it.
See, we grew up near the airport.
It belonged to Paulie.
We had friends and relatives who worked all over it.
They would tip us off about what was coming in and moving out.
If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...
...Paulie's union people scared them with a strike.
It was beautiful.
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers and Jimmy was in charge.
Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport.
To us, it was better than Citibank.
You got a phone?!
Come on!
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?!
There was Jimmy and Tommy...
...and me.
And there was Anthony Stabile.
Frankie Carbone.
And then there was Mo Black's brother, Fat Andy.
And his guys, Frankie the Wop...
...and Freddy No Nose.
And then there was Pete the Killer, who was Sally Balls'brother.
Then you had Nickey Eyes...
...and Mikey Franzese.
Jimmy Two-Times, nicknamed because he said everything twice.
I'll get the papers, get the papers.
What is this, coats?
I need suits, Henry, not coats.
Thursday.
This is the summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?
So I'll take them away.
No, I want them.
We'll hang them in the freezer with the meat.
For us to live any other way was nuts.
To us those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...
...and took the subway to work and worried about bills, were dead.
They were suckers.
They had no balls.
If we wanted something, we just took it.
If anyone complained twice, they got hit so bad they never complained again.
It was all just routine.
You didn't even think about it.
Frankie, what the fuck does ...
...have to do with ?
ain't even close to .
What's that got to do with anything?
Piece of cake.
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just got to get a key.
No problems?
I'll take care of it.
Tell him what you were telling me.
Too good to be true.
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming on.
Americans change their money over into French money, send it back here.
Calm down.
It's beautiful.
It's totally, totally untraceable.
Our only problem is getting a key, but I got a plan.
Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
Yeah, he's a piece of work.
If I'm right, there could be half a mil coming in, all cash.
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday.
There's a Jewish holiday Monday.
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.
What about the security?
Security?
You're looking at it.
It's a joke.
I'm the midnight to eight man.
Just come in like you're picking up lost baggage.
It's beautiful.
There won't be a problem.
Good.
We're on.
What's really funny was that fucking bank job in Secaucus.
I'm in the weeds lying down.
He said, "What are you doing?" I said, "Resting.
Here?" "In the weeds?
I'm resting!" They pull me in, start asking questions.
You know, this and that.
"What are you going to tell us?" I said, "My usual.
Nothing." "Why tell you?" The fuck.
He says, "No, you'll tell me something today." I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother." You saw the paper.
My head was out like this.
I'm coming around and who do I see in front of me?
This prick again.
He says, "What do you want to tell me now?" I said, "What are you doing here?
I said to go fuck your mother." I thought he'd shit.
The fuckers.
I wish I was big just once.
Funny.
You're really funny.
What do you mean?
It's funny, you know.
It's a good story.
You're a funny guy.
You mean the way I talk?
What?
It's just, you know.
You're just funny.
You know, the way you tell the story.
Funny how?
What's funny about it?
You got it all wrong.
He's a big boy.
He knows what he said.
Funny, how?
Just, you know.
You're funny.
Let me understand this.
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.
But I'm funny how?
Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?
You know, how you tell a story.
I don't know.
You said it.
You said I'm funny.
How am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?
Tell me what's funny.
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.
Motherfucker!
I almost had him.
You stuttering prick, you.
Frankie, was he shaking?
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning.
What's with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?
This guy didn't want to give you the check.
Could you take care of this?
No problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab.
I want to talk to you about that.
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.
That ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order...
It's good you don't like to be out of order, Sonny.
Embarrassing me in front of my friends, like I'm a deadbeat.
You're a mutt.
You know the money we spend in this fucking...
Don't be like that.
Like what?
Do you believe him?
You think this is funny?
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!
You don't want to bring the check?
Do you believe this prick?
You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too.
You're a funny guy.
That's it, Henry!
You want to laugh?
This prick asked me to christen his kid.
I charged him seven thousand.
You really are a funny guy.
I'm worried.
I'm hearing bad things.
He treats me like I'm a fucking fag.
I got to go on the lam to get away from this guy.
This ain't right.
I can't go here or there.
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared M.I.A.
They'll find me in a car in the weeds.
You know this Tommy all your life.
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.
When I leave my house in the morning I look over both shoulders.
This is no way to live.
I'm no fence jumper.
Tell me what to do, I'll do it.
What could I do?
If there was something I could do, I would.
I'd like to help you out.
Tell him what we talked about.
Maybe you could come in with me, take a piece of this joint.
It'd be good.
What do you mean?
The restaurant?
It's a classy place.
You've been in here a million times.
Tommy taking over this joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig.
I don't mean disrespect, but that's the way it is.
I'm begging you.
What can I say?
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?
I don't know anything about the restaurant business.
All I know is how to sit down and order a meal.
Not for you.
Just a place to hang.
The chef is great.
The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do?
Shoot him?
That wouldn't'be a bad idea.
Sorry I said that.
I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.
I just need help.
Help me, please.
Know anything about the restaurant business?
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.
Another fucking few minutes, he could be a stool.
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?
What do you think I'm telling you?
Paulie, please.
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.
God bless you, Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.
Now he's got Paulie as a partner.
Any problems, he goes to Paulie.
Trouble with a bill, to Paulie.
Trouble with cops, deliveries, Tommy...
...he calls Paulie.
But now he has to pay Paulie...
...every week no matter what.
"Business bad?
Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire?
Fuck you, pay me." "The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me." Also, Paulie could do anything.
Like run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?
Nobody will pay for it anyway.
Take deliveries at the front door and sell it out the back at a discount.
Take a $ case of booze and sell it for $ .
It doesn't matter.
It's all profit.
Then finally, when there's nothing left...
...when you can't borrow another buck from the bank...
...you bust the joint out.
You light a match.
Do you need help reaching anything?
You look like you're decorating a Christmas tree.
She's from the Five Towns.
Who?
The Jew broad.
Diane.
I been trying to bang her for a month.
She won't go out with me alone.
No.
No what?
No what?
Who asked you anything?
Wait to hear what I'm going to say.
Okay, what?
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?
What is this world coming to?
I can't believe this.
A Jew broad, prejudiced against Italians.
She won't go out without her girlfriend.
So you come along for her friend.
See?
I knew it.
I knew it.
What the fuck is wrong with that?
When is this?
Tomorrow night.
I'm meeting Tuddy.
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.
Why do you always do this?
Don't give me that shit.
What did I ask you for?
A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.
I'm trying to bang this broad.
Help me out.
I don't understand you.
She's beautiful!
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.
You with your fucking mouth!
I had a meeting with Tuddy at and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.
You have enough to eat?
It was delicious.
I'm just watching my diet.
Let me watch your figure.
I couldn't wait to get away.
I was ordering dessert when they ate dinner.
When they had coffee, I was asking for a check.
Some coffee will wake you up.
Joe, can we have the check?
What are you doing?
I got to go.
We just got here.
I got that thing.
We'll leave together.
This way we don't go out like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.
I couldn't stand him.
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.
Good?
You might prefer Manischewitz, but it'd look funny on my table.
Ready?
Lighten up.
We just got here.
What are you doing?
Before it was time to go, he was pushing me into the car...
...then pulling me out.
It was ridiculous.
Diane and Tommy made us promise to meet them again Friday.
We agreed.
But when Friday came around, Henry stood me up.
I feel terrible.
I don't know where he is.
All he did was talk about her.
He liked you.
We were a trio instead of a double date.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
Tommy, what the fuck?
You got some nerve standing me up.
Nobody does that to me.
Who do you think you are, Frankie Valli or some big shot?!
I forgot.
I thought it was next week.
It was this Friday and you agreed, so you're a liar!
We can talk about this.
Talk to you after what you just did to me?
Forget it.
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored.
You said nothing.
Let me make it up to you.
I'll think about it.
I remember, she's screaming on the street and I mean loud.
But she looked good.
I'll think about it.
But it'll cost you, Hill.
A lot.
She had these great eyes, like Liz Taylor's.
Ready?
Come on.
Wait a minute.
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that...
Mom.
Meet my friend, Henry Hill.
My daughter says you're half Jewish.
It's just the good half.
See you later.
You're leaving your car?
He watches the car for me.
It's easier than leaving it at a garage.
It's a lot quicker this way.
This way.
It's better than waiting in line.
Every time I come here.
Every time, you two.
Don't you work?
Henry, nice to see you.
Hi, how are you?
Anthony, right in the front.
Anything you need, let me know.
Tony, thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.
You gave them $ each.
Henry, this is with Mr Tony, over there.
What do you do?
What do you do?
I'm in construction.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
I'm a union delegate.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...the Copacabana is proud to present the king of one-liners...
...Henry Youngman.
How are you all?
I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.
I take my wife everywhere but she finds her way home.
I said, "Where do you wanna go for our anniversary?" She said, "Let's go somewhere I've never been." I said, "Try the kitchen." Dr Wellsler is here.
Gave a guy months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.
Gave him more months.
I love this crowd.
Air France made me.
We walked out with $ without using a gun.
And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.
.
It'll be a good summer.
I'm proud of you.
This is a lot of money for a kid like you.
Anybody asks you where you got it, you got it in Vegas playing craps.
Check, sir.
You have to sign for it here.
Should I tip him?
How are you?
Okay.
And you?
Henry, this is Bruce.
I'll see you around later.
Do you know him?
He lives across the street.
Roses are red, my love Violets are blue Sugar is sweet, my love But not as sweet as you One night, Bobby Vinton sent us champagne.
There was nothing like it.
I didn't think there was anything strange in any of this.
A -year-old kid with such connections.
He was an exciting guy.
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.
He knew how to handle it.
Don't buy wigs that come off at the wrong time.
Morrie's wigs don't come off!
Even underwater.
And remember, Morrie's wigs are tested against hurricane winds.
Forget about money.
You can afford a Morrie wig.
Call me now!
Come in for a personalized fitting.
Morrie, Jimmy's waiting.
You're past due.
I've been good to you.
But there's something unreasonable going on here.
Jimmy's being a ball-breaker.
Give to on Cleveland.
I never had to pay the vigorish he demands.
What am I, a schmuck?
You borrowed his money.
Pay him.
I didn't agree to points above the vig.
What are you going to do?
Are you going to fight with Jimmy Conway?
Give him his money and we'll go.
Fuck him!
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!
Did I ever bust his balls?
I could've dropped a dime a million times.
Don't call the cops.
You're talking crazy.
You got money for that commercial!
You don't got my fucking money?
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.
I'll fucking kill you!
Give me the money, cocksucker.
Pay me!
He'll pay, he'll pay.
Morrie's.
Who's this?
He's here.
Jimmy, I'm sorry.
You should be sorry.
Don't do it again.
Give me my fucking money!
You hear me?!
Give me the fucking money!
I'll give you.
You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.
Karen, slow down.
Where?
Stay there.
Don't move.
It's Karen.
What happened?
What happened?
Are you all right?
Who did it?
This guy who lives across the street from me that I've known all my life.
He started to touch me.
He grabbed me.
I told him to stop.
He didn't stop.
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.
He pushed me out of the car.
You sure you're all right?
Why don't you go inside and get yourself together.
Clean up.
What do you want, fucko?
I swear on my mother, if you touch her again, you're dead.
Don't shoot.
Hide this.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
I know there are women...
...who would have gotten out the minute their boyfriend...
...gave them a gun to hide.
But I didn't.
I got to admit the truth.
It turned me on.
Why don't you be like Henry?
He's got a nice girl.
He's settling down.
He's married.
Soon he'll have a nice family.
And you're still bouncing around from girl to girl.
It was like he had two families.
The first time I was introduced to all of them at once, it was crazy.
Paulie and his brothers had lots of sons and nephews.
Almost all of them were named Peter or Paul.
It was unbelievable.
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.
There must have been dozen Peters and Pauls there...
This is Marie.
...all married to girls named Marie.
She looks Italian.
And they named their daughters Marie.
And this is Pete.
No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.
By the time I met everybody, I thought I was drunk.
Paulie, you shouldn't have.
Welcome to the family.
Sunday dinner?
So beautiful.
I want to cry.
Something to help you get started.
The bag.
The bag.
The bag with the envelopes in it, the money.
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to steal that here.
He didn't call?
He's with his friends.
What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown-up.
He doesn't have to call every minutes.
A grown-up would get you an apartment.
Don't start.
Mom, you're the one who wanted us here.
You're here a month.
Sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all.
What kind of people are these?
What do you want me to do?
What can you do?
He's not Jewish.
Did you know what these people were like?
Your father never stayed out all night.
Daddy never went out at all, Ma!
Keep out of it!
You don't know how I feel!
How do you feel now?
You don't know where he is or who he's with!
He's with his friends!
Dad!
Leave him alone.
He's suffered enough.
He hasn't digested a decent meal in weeks.
Where were you?!
Why didn't you call?!
We were worried!
A married man does not stay out like this!
Normal people don't act like this!
What's wrong with you?
You're not normal.
She's right!
What's wrong with you?!
What kind of person are you?!
What is the matter with you?!
What kind of people are they?
We weren't married to guys.
But the first time I realized how different...
...was when Mickey had a hostess party.
Karen, where you from?
Lawrence.
On the Island.
Nice.
I'm from Miami.
Ever been there?
It's okay, but it's like you died and woke up in Jew heaven.
Stop picking at that.
I'd like to smack his face.
The red-haired guy?
The guy's hands are all over me.
So I say, "Keep your fucking hands off me or I'll cut them off." She means it.
He's lucky.
I just mention this to Vinnie...
How can you mention it?
Vinnie'd kill him.
Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard, then he'll be there for life.
Talk about problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?
He was in an argument.
A $ card game.
He pulls out a gun.
The gun goes off.
Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears...
...she has a heart attack and drops dead.
Now Jeannie has a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
Jeannie drinks.
Maybe she's depressed.
Give me a break.
She's drunk.
As soon as something happens, you make them out to be saints.
They had bad skin and wore too much makeup.
They didn't look very good.
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore...
...was thrown together and cheap.
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.
She spends her life in a nightgown.
The woman is no angel, believe me.
They talked about their rotten kids...
...and about beating them with broom handles and belts.
And the kids still didn't listen.
When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.
I don't know if I could live like that!
God forbid, what would happen if you had to go to prison?
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband...
Do you know why Jeannie's husband went to the can?
Because he wanted to get away from her.
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.
Unless they make themselves get caught.
They don't have things organized.
I know what I'm doing.
You know who goes to jail?
Nigger stickup men.
Know why they get caught?
Because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.
After a while, it got to be all normal.
None of it seemed like crimes.
Henry was just enterprising.
He and the guys make bucks hustling while other guys...
...sat on their asses waiting for handouts.
Our husbands weren't brain surgeons, just blue-collar guys...
The only way they could make real money was to go out and cut corners.
Where's the strong box, you varmint?!
Don't fucking move!
Don't move!
See you at the diner.
I'm riding shotgun.
Did you see him give it right over?
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.
We were all very close.
There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.
Being together all the time made everything seem all the more normal.
Police.
I'm Detective Deacy.
This is Detective Silvestri.
We have a search warrant.
Would you read and sign it?
Anywhere?
We have to go through everything.
You want some coffee?
No coffee now, thanks.
Be careful.
We'll just go about our business.
There was always some harassment.
They wanted to talk to Henry about this or that.
They'd make me sign their subpoenas or warrants.
But mostly they just wanted a handout.
A few bucks to keep things quiet no matter what they found.
I always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway...
...used to curse at them and spit on the floor.
On her own floor!
That never made any sense to me.
It was better to be polite and call the lawyer.
Happy birthday to you.
We always did everything together and were always in the same crowd.
Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.
The women played cards.
When kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy were the first at the hospital.
When we went to the Islands or Vegas for vacation...
...we went together.
No outsiders ever.
It got to be normal.
I began to be proud that my husband was willing to risk his neck...
...to get us the little extras.
But I got Mom to watch the babies tomorrow night.
Can't do it.
Why not?
I just can't.
I got something lined up.
But tomorrow's the only night she can do it.
Pretty please?
I can't.
What do you want me to do?
I got to go.
Wait a minute.
I need money to go shopping.
How much?
That much.
This much.
Give me a kiss.
See you later.
All right.
I always dreamed the boy I love would come along And he'd be tall and handsome, rich and strong Welcome home, Batts.
Sit down.
Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.
There's only one Irishman here.
It's a celebration.
Top of the morning.
It's good to be home.
This is my friend Jimmy.
Henry.
It's his joint.
This is Lisa.
Tommy.
All dressed up.
All grown up and doing the town.
Forgot you were having a party for him.
Come here.
I'll say hello.
How are you Billy?
I haven't seen you in years.
Jesus Christ Almighty.
You look terrific.
Watch the suit.
You little prick.
I know you all my life.
Don't get too big on me.
Just don't bust my balls.
If I was gonna bust your balls, I'd say, "Go get your shine box." This kid was great.
"Spitshine Tommy." He'd make your shoes look like fucking mirrors.
Excuse my language.
He was the best.
Made a lot of money.
No more shines.
No more shines.
You been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.
I don't shine shoes anymore.
What's got into you?
I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.
I'm only kidding with you.
You don't sound like it.
There's people around.
I'm kidding.
We're having a party.
I haven't seen you in a long time and you get fresh.
I don't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry, too.
Now go home and get your shine box.
Motherfucking mutt!
You fucking piece of shit!
Come on, come on!
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy.
You bought your fucking button!
Don't get nervous.
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here!
You fucking feel strong?
Sorry.
Tommy's loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.
No disrespect?
Are you nuts?
Teach this kid some manners.
What's right is right.
You understand?
It's okay.
We're hugging and kissing over here and then he acts like a jerk.
You insulted him a little bit.
I didn't.
You insulted him a little.
I didn't.
Give us a drink.
Drinks on the house.
No, have the drink with me.
The drinks are on the house.
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.
Fucking break up my party.
You been away for years.
It's different now.
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.
You're gonna get it.
You understand?
Get the door!
Let me shoot him in his fucking mouth!
Let's shoot him.
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.
His crew'll be looking for him.
This is bad.
What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.
I know a place upstate they'll never find him.
More tablecloths.
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.
Go open your trunk.
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her.
Look who's here.
What happened?
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.
What happened to him?
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?
You, too.
How are you?
Why are you up so late?
He came in.
Youse came in.
I'm so happy to see him.
Go inside.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.
Go to sleep.
We're leaving.
I can't.
Not while he's home.
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.
Youse go inside.
This stuff is like lead.
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.
You haven't called.
Where have you been?
I been working nights.
And tonight we were out late.
We took a ride out to the country and hit a deer.
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay?
Just for a while.
The poor thing.
We hit the deer and his paw...
What do you call it?
The paw.
The hoof.
Got caught in the grill.
I got to hack it off.
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.
I'll bring the knife back.
Delicious.
Why not get yourself a nice girl.
I do, almost every night.
But a girl you could settle down with.
I do, every night.
Then I'm free.
I love you!
I want to be with you.
Settle down.
How's your friend Henry?
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
You don't talk much.
Talk.
What are you quiet for?
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.
I'm just listening.
Something wrong?
When we were kids, the "compares" used to visit one another.
There was this man.
He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?" He says, "What am I going to say, that my wife two-times me?" So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking!" But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.
Cornuto content.
That's it.
It means he's content to be a jerk.
He doesn't care who knows it.
Did Tommy tell you about my painting?
Look at this.
It's beautiful.
One dog goes one way and the other goes the other.
One's facing east, the other west.
He's saying, "Whaddya want from me?" The guy's got a nice head of white hair.
Beautiful.
The dog looks the same.
Looks like someone we know.
Without the beard.
It's him.
It's him.
What is that?
For most of the guys, killings were accepted.
Murder was the only way everybody stayed in line.
You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.
Sometimes, even if people didn't get out of line, they got whacked.
Hits became a habit.
Guys would argue over nothing.
Before you knew it, one was dead.
They were shooting each other all the time.
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.
Batts was part of the Gambino crew and considered untouchable.
Before you touched a made guy, you needed a good reason.
You had to get an okay...
...or you'd get whacked.
Saturday night was for wives, but...
...Friday at the Copa was for the girlfriends.
We saw Sammy Davis, Jr.
You got to see this show.
What a performer!
He does impersonations.
It was like the real people!
Unbelievable.
You could see how a white girl could fall for him.
Not me.
But you could see how some girls could.
Like that Swedish girl.
So you condone that stuff.
Take it easy.
I don't want to be kissing Nat King Cole over here.
I don't mean me.
But, you know, he's got personality.
"Personality"?
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.
I just said he was talented.
Just leave it alone now.
He's talented.
Leave it at that.
Pretend you don't see her, my heart Although she is coming...
Our way Pretend you don't need her My heart But smile and pretend To be gay It's too late for running...
My heart Chin up if the tears...
Start to fall Look somewhere above her Pretend you don't love her Pretend you don't see her At all.
No?
Not even Uncle Paulie?
What do you hear about that thing?
The Brooklyn thing?
The guy from downtown.
The guy from where Christie lived?
The guy who disappeared, the one they made the beef on.
Know the guy I mean?
His name was Batts.
His people are driving everyone crazy looking for him.
Nobody knows what happened.
He came into the joint that night and then just disappeared.
Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.
Okay, everybody, let's eat.
I want my money.
I want my money.
He owes it.
You know that thing we took care of upstate?
Paulie was talking about that.
We must move it.
They just sold the property to make condominiums.
It's been months.
We got to move it right away.
Henry, hurry up.
My mother's making fried peppers and sausage for us.
Here's an arm.
Very funny.
Here's a leg.
Here's a wing.
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still prefer the hearts and lungs?
Oh, that's so bad.
What happened to the car?
I hit a skunk, all right?
Go with your mother.
It's disgusting, Henry.
I set up Janice in an apartment near The Suite.
That way I was able to stay over a few nights a week.
My new antique lamp.
Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.
Looks like Roma.
This is all silk.
This is from Siam.
Come see my bedroom.
Tommy, will you take him?
I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.
Love that crystal ball or what?
This is where we spend most of our time.
I love the floral arrangements.
French.
Janice and I had so much fun, she screwed up at work.
I had to straighten out her boss.
Janice can do what she wants to do!
Got it?!
Just try and run.
Hang up once more and you'll deal with me!
Get off of her.
You're an animal.
Spider, on your way here, bring me a Cutty and water.
I'll play these.
You'll play those?
Do I stutter?
I play those.
What am I, a mirage?
Where's my fucking drink?
You wanted a drink?
I asked you for one.
You said, "I'm all right, Spider." Am I on a pay-no-mind list?
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider." I thought it was Henry.
You're a stuttering fuck.
You said, "I'm all right, Spider." You ain't all right.
No, you said you were all right.
I am all right!
You ain't, you prick.
You been doing this all night to me, motherfucker!
You want a drink?
I'll bring it.
Get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you prick!
You walk like Stepin Fetchit.
Everybody else you run.
Run for me!
Dance the fucking drink back here!
What's that Bogart movie?
Where he played a cowboy.
"The Oklahoma Kid." "Oklahoma Kid." "Shane?" Oklahoma Kid, that's me.
You fucking varmint.
Dance!
Yahoo, motherfucker!
Round up those fucking wagons.
Now he's moving.
He got him in the foot.
He's fine.
So he got shot in the foot.
Big fucking deal.
Get a towel.
Nice fucking game.
Take him to Ben Casey.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.
Take him to the doctor down the street.
Bones are all shattered.
Don't get me upset.
Don't make a big fucking thing out of it, Spider!
You trying to make me think what I did here.
It was an accident.
Little fucking actor.
You in?
I'm in.
.
?!
You haven't been home in weeks!
You're not going out tonight!
Will you grow up?!
I'm still going to go out!
Not without your car keys.
Are you nuts?
Is that your problem?
Yes!
Something's going on!
Stop with that.
Enough!
Stop with that!
I look in your face and I know you're lying!
Get out!
Get out!
Shut up!
Out of my life!
You're fucked in the head.
It's in your mind.
You're a lousy bastard!
You got a problem.
Go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!
Get out of my life!
I can't stand you!
Spider, what's your rush?
Thank you.
Spider, that bandage on your foot is bigger than your fucking head.
Next thing you know he'll have one of these fucking walkers.
But you can still dance.
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter.
Tell the truth.
You want sympathy.
Got fuck yourself, Tommy.
I didn't hear right.
I can't believe what I heard.
This is for you.
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of balls.
Good.
Don't take shit from nobody.
He tells him to go fuck himself.
Tommy, you going to let this fucking punk get away with that?
What's this world coming to?
That's what the fucking world's coming to.
How's that?
What is wrong with you?!
What is the fucking matter with you?!
Are you stupid or what?
I was kidding with you.
Are you a sick maniac?
How do I know you're kidding?
I'm kidding with you, you fucking shoot the guy?!
He's dead.
Good shot.
I'm a good shot.
Hard to miss at this distance.
You got a problem with what I did?
His family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.
Stupid bastard!
I can't believe you.
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.
I'll dig the hole.
I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?
Not the first hole I dug.
Where are the shovels?
It's Karen Hill.
I want to talk to you.
Hello?
Don't hang up on me!
I want to talk to you!
You keep away from my husband, you hear me?
Open the door!
Answer me!
I'll tell everyone who walks in here...
...that in R, Rossi, you are nothing but a whore!
Superintendent?
I want you to know you have a whore...
...in R!
Rossi, Janice Rossi.
Do you hear me?
He's my husband!
Get your own goddamn man!
Wake up.
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
I am crazy.
And I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.
Karen, take it easy.
Do you love her?
Do you?!
Do you?
I love you.
You know I love you.
You don't.
No, you don't.
Be careful, baby.
Don't.
But still I couldn't hurt him.
How could I hurt him?
I couldn't even leave him.
The truth was...
...no matter how bad I felt...
...I was still very attracted to him.
Why give him to someone else?
Why should she win?
Just put it down.
You know I love you, don't you?
You're all I want, Karen.
Please put the gun down.
Baby, come on.
What are you, fucking crazy?!
I got enough to worry about getting whacked on the street!
I got to fucking come home for this?!
I should fucking kill you!
How does it feel?
How does it feel, Karen?
I'm sorry!
Hi, Jimmy!
How are you?
Looking good.
Thank you.
Good to see you.
Go get some cigarettes, okay?
Anybody else?
I'm all right.
You want anything to drink?
Chinese food?
Karen came by.
She's very upset.
You got to straighten this out.
We got to have calm.
We don't know what she'll do.
She's hysterical.
Very excited.
She's wild.
And you got to take it easy.
You got children.
I'm not saying go back to her right now, but you got to go back.
You got to keep up appearances.
The two of them come to my house every day.
I just can't have it.
I can't do it, Henry.
I can't do it.
Nobody says you can't do what you want.
We all know that.
This is what it is.
We know what it is.
You have to do what's right.
You have to go home to the family.
You got to go home, okay?
Look at me.
You got to go home.
Smarten up.
I'll talk to Karen.
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.
I'll say you'll go back to her and it'll be like when you first got married.
I'll romance her.
It'll be beautiful.
I know how to talk to her.
In the meantime, Jimmy and Tommy were going to Tampa this weekend.
Instead you go with Jimmy.
You come with me.
Have a good time.
Sit in the sun.
Take a few days off.
We'll have a good time.
After that, you'll go back to Karen.
There's no other way.
No divorce.
We're not animali.
No divorce.
She'll never divorce him.
She'll kill him, but not divorce him.
You going to pay it?
Give us the money!
I can't.
We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
Lions?
I ain't going near any lions!
Throw him over the moat.
I'll get the money!
They must really feed each other to the lions, 'cause he gave the money right up.
I'll get the money.
We spent the rest of the weekend at the track.
They mean business.
Then, I couldn't believe what happened.
When we got home, we were all over the newspaper.
At first I didn't even know why we got picked up.
Then I found out the guy we roughed up...
...had a sister working as a typist for the FBI.
I couldn't believe it.
Of all people.
She gave up everybody.
Jimmy, me.
Even her brother.
It took the jury hours to bring us in guilty.
The judge gave us years like he was giving away candy.
years in a federal penitentiary.
You will now be turned over...
...to the Attorney General.
Toast, guys.
Good trip, good life.
Get out soon.
Good trip, sweetheart.
We'll watch the home front.
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.
Motherfuck them every chance you get.
I'll call you when I get a chance.
Take me to jail.
In prison, dinner was always a big thing.
We had a pasta course, then we had a meat or a fish.
Paulie was doing a year for contempt...
...and had a wonderful system for garlic.
He used a razor and sliced it so thin...
...it would liquefy in the pan with a little oil.
It's a very good system.
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.
Get that smell?
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs.
Veal, beef, and pork.
You got to have pork.
That's the flavor.
I felt he used too many onions, but it was still a good sauce.
Don't put in too many onions.
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.
There are only small onions.
Three onions?
How many tomatoes?
Two big cans.
You don't need onions.
Johnny Dio did the meat.
We had no broiler, so he did everything in pans.
It smelled up the joint and the hacks used to die...
...but he cooked a great steak.
How do you like yours?
Medium rare.
Medium rare.
An aristocrat.
When you think of prison you get pictures in your mind...
...of all those old movies with rows and rows of guys behind bars.
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.
It wasn't bad, but I missed Jimmy, who was doing his time in Atlanta.
Give me two steaks.
Everyone else in the joint was doing real time, all together, living like pigs.
But we lived alone.
We owned the joint.
We batted them sons-of-bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.
They deserved it.
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe wouldn't rat on the guys we did.
People used to be able to leave their door open.
Sorry it took so long.
That skinny guard's a pain in the ass.
We have to take care of that bastard.
I took care of him.
What'd you bring?
Some bread.
I got peppers and onions.
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.
What else?
Scotch.
Red wine.
Now we can eat.
Some white, too.
Beautiful.
Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, Johnny, Vinnie.
Tomorrow sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.
Read'em and weep.
What are you doing?
I'll catch you guys later.
Going to the park?
I'll catch you next week.
Any more?
No, that's it.
Have a good weekend.
You girls stay right here.
Hold hands.
Go right up front.
What?
I saw her name on the register.
Want her to visit?
Let her stay up all night writing to the parole board.
What am I doing here?
Where am I?!
I'm in jail.
I can't stop people from visiting me.
Let her sneak this stuff in for you every week.
Let her fight these bastards every week!
Look what you're doing!
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
Let her sneak this shit in for you.
Will you stop it?
Let her do it!
Stop it!
Nobody's helping me.
I am all alone.
Belle and Morrie are broke.
I asked your friend Remo for the money he owes you.
He told me to take the kids down to the police station and get on welfare.
It's going to be okay.
I never even see Paulie since he got out.
I never see anyone.
That's what happens when you go away.
We're on our own.
Forget everybody else.
Forget Paulie.
As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
I can't do it.
You can.
All I need is you to bring me this stuff.
A guy from Pittsburgh will help me move it.
In a month we'll be fine.
We won't need anybody.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...
He is not helping us.
Is he putting any food on the table?
We've got to help each other.
We got to be really, really careful while we do it.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Never.
We missed you.
Are you here to stay?
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.
I did the sun.
My chorus concert is in weeks.
Are you coming?
Do you like the house?
Get packed.
We're moving out.
With what?
Don't worry.
Just start looking for a new house.
I got to go to Pittsburgh.
Those guys owe me $ .
We'll be okay.
I got things lined up.
Pittsburgh?
You have to see your parole officer.
Don't worry about it.
Everything will be fine.
Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
What do you want?
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.
You look good.
Did we eat this good in the joint?
I don't want any more of that shit.
What are you talking about?
Just stay away from the garbage.
Inside, you did what you had to do.
I'm talking about now.
About here and now.
Why would I get into that?
Don't make a jerk of me.
Just don't do it.
Don't.
I want to talk about Jimmy.
Watch out for him.
He's a good earner, but takes too many chances.
I wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.
He's got too much to prove.
You got to watch out for them.
I only use them for certain things.
I ain't going to get fucked like Gribbs.
Gribbs is years old and he'll die in prison.
I don't need that.
So I'm warning everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.
Gribbs got years just for saying hello to some fuck who was selling junk.
That won't happen to me, understand?
You're out early because I got you a job.
I don't need this heat.
You see anybody with shit you tell me.
Anybody.
Of course.
It took me a week of sneaking around to unload the Pittsburgh stuff.
But when I did, it was a real score.
I used Sandy's place to mix the stuff.
Even with Sandy snorting more than she mixed, I saw this was a good business.
I made $ in my second week.
I had a down payment on my house and things were rolling.
All I had to do was once in a while tell Sandy I loved her.
It was perfect.
Since I got the stuff from Pittsburgh, Paulie would never find out.
Within a couple of weeks it got so big I needed some help.
I got Jimmy and Tommy to come in with me.
It's fucking great.
You bring your pay slips?
Four and a half months of dirt.
It's so good.
I did it.
Do you love it?
It's wonderful.
This we had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it.
The others you couldn't even sit in.
Okay, ready?
Watch the wall with the rock.
The electricians did it special.
Come on.
This was imported.
It came in pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?
Nice, huh?
Come here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?
He's looking into everything.
It'll make Air France look like peanuts.
Come on.
He'll do it, right?
I told you.
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens.
No promises.
Do you understand?
There's millions in there.
I've been cultivating this son-of-a-bitch for years.
He owes me grand.
Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit.
My dream comes true.
Let's get a drink.
These are the guys Jimmy put together for what turned out to be...
...the biggest heist in American history.
The Lufthansa heist.
Tommy and Carbone would grab the guard and make him get us in the front door.
Frenchy and Joe Buddha had to round up the workers.
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them tied up and away from the alarms.
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.
He used to play guitar at the lounge.
Everybody loved Stacks.
He was supposed to steal the truck...
...and afterwards compact it by a friend of ours in Jersey.
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.
Have a drink and shut up.
Just because he set this up...
...he bugged Jimmy for an advance on the money we could steal.
He didn't mean anything by it.
That's just the way he was.
I had everyone working for me.
Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.
Have a good flight?
I hate Pittsburgh.
They're such creeps.
They're not that bad.
And it's worth it.
Is this the same baby you used last week?
No, that was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.
Big yawn.
She looks like you.
That's what the stewardess said.
Take it easy.
Give me a break.
You got plenty.
You got all day.
Let's make it last, all right?
Take it easy.
I got to go.
Where are you going?
Don't start.
You know I got to go do this thing.
Where are my keys?
Over there.
It's a mess.
It's like a pig pen.
I got you a dishwasher.
Fucks up my nails.
You got to be smart.
There's enough powder here to put us away forever.
Loosen up.
What are you doing?
You don't have to go anywhere.
Make them wait.
Nobody knows for sure how much was taken in the pre-dawn raid...
...at the Lufthansa cargo terminal.
The FBI says $ Port Authority says $ .
Those sons-of-bitches!
...the scene of the heist at JFK.
It looks like a big one.
Maybe the biggest this town has ever seen.
Come here, you!
Come here!
Look at this genius.
This genius!
Merry Christmas, Jimmy!
Who's this?
This is my wife.
Come here.
I want to show you something, Jimmy.
Isn't she gorgeous?
I bought it for my wife.
It's a coupe.
I love that car.
What did I tell you?
I talked to you, didn't I?
Didn't I say not to go buy anything for a while?
The fucking car.
It's a wedding gift from my mother.
It's under her name.
I just got married.
I love that car.
Excuse me for a second.
I just got married.
Are you nuts?
Why are you getting excited?
Are you stupid?
We got a million bulls out there.
Everyone's watching us.
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.
I don't give a fuck.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.
Don't get anything.
What's the matter with you?
What are you getting excited for?
Because you're going to get us all pinched.
What's the matter with you?
I apologize.
I'm sorry.
What's the matter with you?!
I'm sorry.
It's under my mother's name.
What'd you say?
You being a wiseguy?!
I'm sorry.
I apologize.
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?!
You don't buy anything.
You don't buy anything.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
The fat fuck ought to wear a sign.
I can't believe this.
Are you stupid?
Excuse me.
Take it off.
Take it off.
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big or attract attention?
One guy gets a Caddy and one gets a $ mink.
I'll return it.
Bring it where you got it.
Get it out of here.
Understand?
Get it out of here!
This drink here is better that sex, babe.
I'm going to see Stacks.
Don't you look at anybody or I'll kill you.
He's so jealous.
If I even look at anyone else, he'll kill me.
That's great.
I tell them all not to attract attention.
What do they do?
I've been looking all over for you.
Listen, I need the money.
Morrie, relax, okay?
It's Christmas.
I need the money.
I'm relaxing.
I need the money.
I did what I had to do.
Not tonight, Morrie.
I did my caper.
He owes me.
Everyone's flashing stuff.
They got money.
I'm wearing the same shit.
They're wearing it.
I got to talk to him.
I got grand coming to me.
The biggest bundle he made in his life.
I'll go talk to him.
Go have a drink.
I'll talk to him.
It's poison to my eyes.
Morris, are you all right?
No.
Christmas.
Your share.
Just a little taste.
We did it.
Who is it?
It's me.
Pete?
One second.
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron.
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!
I got the most expensive tree they had.
What do you think, Mommy?
I love them all.
I love the gold outfit.
Merry Christmas.
And?
And?
Happy Hanukkah.
Very funny.
Go get yourself something nice.
Lufthansa should have been our ultimate score.
The heist of a lifetime.
Six million in cash.
More than enough to go around.
Yo, Stacks!
Open up!
What's with you?
He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.
You didn't bring any coffee?
Do I look like a caterer?
Frankie will make coffee.
Make coffee.
Thought you'd have a bitch in here.
I did.
Where the fuck is she?
Always got these hot books around or a bitch.
What time is it?
: .
We were to be there by .
I'll be ready in a minute.
You're always late.
You'd be late for your own funeral.
What are you looking at?
Make that coffee to go.
Let's go.
What the fuck you doing?
It's a joke.
A joke.
Put the fucking pot down.
Stacks was always crazy.
Instead of getting rid of the truck as he was supposed to, he got stoned...
...went to his girlfriend's, and when he woke up, the cops had found the truck.
It was all over the television.
They even said they got prints off the wheel.
It was just a matter of time before they got to Stacks.
I got to talk to you.
Have a drink.
Have a drink.
Come on.
Have a drink.
What are you doing?
It's an occasion.
Have a drink.
I still have to talk to you.
What happened with Stacks?
Don't worry about that.
There's feds all over the place.
So what?
Where are they going to go?
It's in the papers.
He's worried.
What are you worried about?
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.
What are you worried about?
You worry too much.
Everything is beautiful.
Didn't you tell him?
Not yet.
Guess what.
They are going to make him.
Paulie's going to make you?
They opened the books.
Paulie got the okay.
Can you believe that?
This guinea bastard.
He's getting made.
We'll work for this guy one day.
He'll be a boss.
I can't believe him.
I'm happy for you.
Congratulations.
Motherfuckers, we got them now.
I've been looking all over for you.
Can I talk to you a second?
I masterminded the whole thing, I'm left with dick.
They be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him!
I want my money.
I want my money.
I've had it up to here.
Fuck him!
I want my money!
Good.
Go tell him.
Now will you keep you mouth shut?
Morrie, you'll get your money.
You just got to stop busting balls.
All right.
You hear me?
Everything's going to be fine.
Oh, Henry boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling Half mick, half guinea.
I'll sing with an Italian accent.
And down the glen, the glen, and down the mountainside.
The summer's gone.
And all the roses dying I could see for the first time that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.
His mind was going in eight different directions at once.
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?
Morrie?
Him?
That's when I knew Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.
That's how it happens.
That's how fast it takes for a guy to get whacked.
He's a nut job.
He talks to everybody.
He's always acting like a jerk.
Nobody listens to what he says.
Nobody cares what he says, he talks so much.
Make sure you bring him here tonight.
Okay?
All right.
Start like this.
Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?
Stop breaking my balls.
I was just stalling for time.
I knew I had 'til or to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.
But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew, I was going along with the program.
I pulled out his hair.
I bit him.
He's out cold.
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.
We start to go in this joint.
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's doing this to me.
I don't want to turn around.
I don't want to turn around.
He picks up his fucking head, he says, "Ah..." I said, "Don't say it!" "Jerkoff!" What are you going to do?
What?
I fly at him.
I got him and I'm banging his head, banging his face.
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.
I bit him to a pulp.
To a pulp I beat him.
He's laying there full of blood.
I'm out of breath.
Forget about tonight.
Forget it.
It was a load off my mind.
He never knew how close he'd come to getting killed.
Even if I told him he would never have believed me.
Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
You're a pisser.
A real pisser.
Want to talk now?
Okay, let's talk.
I've never met a ball buster like you.
Who loves you more than I do?
I'd do anything for you.
Except stop busting my balls.
Let's go have coffee.
Want to go to the diner?
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.
Which diner?
Rockaway Boulevard.
It's open hours.
They got danish?
They got everything.
Let's pick up danish for Belle.
Hear about the points we were shaving in Boston?
It's terrific.
Nunzio...
I thought he'd never shut up.
What a pain in the ass.
What'll we do with him?
Chop him up and get rid of the car.
Call me when you're through.
Let's chop him up.
Where you going, dizzy motherfucker?
You said chop him up.
At Charlie's.
Where will we do it here?
Come on.
Get out of here.
I got a better shot letting him drive.
The car's cold.
Get out of here!
What, warm it up?
Get out of here!
Who is it?
It's Belle.
Open up.
It's Belle.
Let me in.
Morris didn't come home.
He's missing I know something happened.
Calm down.
He's missing!
I know something happened.
He probably fell asleep somewhere.
In years he's never been away all night without calling.
Something's happened.
I know you know.
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home then look for him.
I've been home!
I've been on the phone...
He's playing cards.
What'll I tell Belle?
Who gives a fuck?
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?
Watch this.
Don't fuck with me.
I bust their balls all the time.
Don't give them the satisfaction, those fucks.
Come on, fuckos.
Let's go for a ride.
Keep them up all night, I'll see you later.
Jimmy was cutting every link between himself and the robbery...
...but it had nothing to do with me.
I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me some Christmas money.
From then on, I kept my mouth shut.
I knew Jimmy.
He had the cash.
It was his.
He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie, but that was it.
It made him sick to turn money over to the guys who stole it.
He'd rather whack them.
What did I care?
I wasn't asking for anything.
And Jimmy was making nice money through my Pittsburgh connections.
Still, months after the robbery they were finding bodies all over.
When they found Carbone in the meat truck he was frozen so stiff...
...it took them days to thaw him out for the autopsy.
I never saw Jimmy so happy.
He was like a kid.
We had money coming in through Pittsburgh...
...and even after a while the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.
Jimmy was so happy that morning...
...because this was the day Tommy was being made.
Jimmy was so excited you'd think he was being made.
He must have made four calls to Tommy's house.
They had a signal set up so he'd know the minute the ceremony was over.
Ma, where are you?
Here I am.
You're home.
Home?
I'm leaving.
You look lovely.
I look good, huh?
You look wonderful.
Be careful.
I wish you lots of luck.
I love you.
Don't paint any religious pictures.
God be with you.
We always called each other good fellas.
You'd say to somebody: "You'll like this guy.
He's all right.
He's a good fella, one of us." Understand?
We were good fellas.
Wiseguys.
Jimmy and me could never be made because we had Irish blood.
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.
To become a member of a crew you must be % Italian...
...so they can trace your relatives to the old country.
It's the highest honor they can give you.
It means you belong to a family and a crew.
It means nobody can fuck around with you.
Also, you can fuck around with anybody, as long as they aren't also a member.
It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.
How many years since you was made?
I'm an old-timer.
Thirty years ago.
Bring back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?
As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy being made...
...it was like we were all being made.
We would now have one of our own as a member.
Who's this?
Vinnie.
What happened?
Did we get straightened out?
We had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.
You know what I mean.
He's gone, and we couldn't do nothing about it.
What do you mean?
He's gone.
He's gone.
That's it.
I knew it!
I can't fucking believe it.
They fucking whacked him.
Are you all right?
It was revenge for Billy Batts, and a lot of other things.
That's that.
There was nothing we could do about it.
Batts was a made man; Tommy wasn't.
We had to sit still and take it.
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.
They even shot Tommy in the face...
...so his mother couldn't give him an open-casket funeral.
I had a busy day.
I had to drop guns off at Jimmy's...
...to match some silencers he had.
I had to pick up my brother at the hospital...
...and pick up some stuff for Lois...
...to fly down to some customers in Atlanta.
Right away I knew he didn't want them and I'd be stuck for the money.
I bought them because he wanted them and now he didn't want them.
What good are these?
None of them fit.
I'm not paying for these.
I didn't say a thing.
Jimmy was so pissed he didn't say good-bye.
The drugs are making your mind into mush.
I'll return them.
My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.
Since I would see them in the afternoon, I was pretty sure...
...I'd get my money back.
Oh, my God.
At the hospital, Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.
What happened to you?
I almost got into an accident on the way here.
And I told him I was partying all night.
I'm fine.
Get over here.
Let me check you out.
He took mercy on me, gave me Valium...
...and sent me home.
My plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up Karen.
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?
Right up there.
It's been following me all morning.
Are you nuts?
I'm telling you.
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital.
I had to make some stops.
I've been all over town and I've seen it all day.
I was cooking dinner.
I had to start braising the beef and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with gravy...
...roasted peppers...
...string beans with olive oil, and beautiful cutlets...
...that were cut just right...
...that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.
So I was home for about an hour.
My plan was to start dinner early so I could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want.
Then get the package for Lois to take to Atlanta later that night.
I kept looking out the window and saw that the helicopter was gone.
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.
I asked my brother to watch the sauce and Karen and I started out.
Oh, God.
I see it.
It's right there.
That's it.
We got to get to your mother's.
I told you.
It's funny.
It's not the end of the world.
Let's get to your mother's.
Tell your mother not to touch anything outside of the house.
Nothing.
Why didn't you go to your mother's house?
Everything gonna be all right in the morning.
Let's go shopping.
It's been following me all morning He thinks I'm paranoid.
I should bring him the helicopter, then we'll see how paranoid I am.
Come on, let's go inside.
It's gone.
I don't hear it.
Let's go back to your mother's.
They all right?
They're great.
Didn't I say you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?
Yeah.
I need a hit.
Want to see helicopters?
I'll show you helicopters.
I've seen enough helicopters for one day, thank you.
I had to get home and get the package ready for Lois to take on her trip.
I also had to get to Sandy's to give the package a whack with quinine.
And I knew Sandy would get on my ass.
I had cooking to finish, and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.
It's Sandy.
What the fuck is this?
She's a pain in the ass.
When are you coming over?
In an hour.
You staying tonight?
I can't.
I got my brother tonight.
Come on, stop.
Stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay?
Good-bye.
It's me.
You ready?
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.
Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
I'm stirring it.
Listen, you know what to do?
Don't "yeah, yeah" me.
This is important.
Leave the house when you make the call.
Understand me?
Call from an outside line.
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb.
I know what to do.
You hick, just make sure you do it.
You're a pain.
Hey!
Just do it!
Un-fucking-believable.
All of them.
every fucking girl in my life.
What'd he say?
Nothing.
What does she do after she hangs up?
After everything I told her?
After all her "yeah, yeah" bullshit?
She calls from the house.
If anyone was listening they'd know everything.
They'd know a package was leaving my house and they'd have the flight number.
I got home and started cooking.
I had a few hours before Lois'flight.
I told my brother to watch the stove.
All day long the poor guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce.
I had to drive over to Sandy's, mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.
Do you think you can come over, fuck me, then leave?
Got someplace better to go?
Don't talk like that.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah.
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
That the last one?
You lying son-of-a-bitch!
I hate you!
Please stop feeding the dog from the table...
...from the plate on top of it.
Stop it.
I have to.
You don't have to.
I got to go home.
What do you mean?
We got to tape this stuff to your leg.
We got to go soon.
I got to go home and get my hat.
Forget your hat.
Are you kidding me?
I need a trip to Rockaway because you want your hat?!
I got to have it.
It's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.
Do you understand what we are involved in?
I don't care.
I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.
What could I do if she insisted I drive her home for her damn hat?
I hid the package and went to take her home.
What the fuck is this?
Police!
Don't move, motherfucker.
I'll blow your brains out.
Shut the car off.
I thought I was dead, but when I heard the noise I knew they were cops.
Only cops talk that way.
Don't fucking move.
If they had been wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a thing.
I would have been dead.
Michael!
Lock the door!
Talk to me.
When was the last time you took a collar?
I'm talking to you.
You don't want to talk, don't talk.
I don't give a fuck.
You'll do years.
See how much of a good guy you'll be then.
All day I thought the guys in the helicopter...
...were local cops busting my balls over Lufthansa.
They turned out to be narcs.
Get the lawyer.
They'd been on me a month.
Phone taps, surveillance.
You know the boys.
All the pals are here.
You don't want to talk to me, you'll have a problem all night.
Each one of these counts holds to life in New York state.
fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.
What, were you guys grocery shopping?
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?
You got anything good in there?
Is it good?
Bye-bye, dickhead.
See you in Attica.
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.
He wants to talk to you, to know what's happening.
Fuck Jimmy and his money.
I got to straighten out everything with Paulie or I'm dead.
Then you're safer in here.
They could whack me here as easy as out- side.
They're afraid I'll rat them out.
People are already walking away from me.
You got to get me out.
Karen finally got her mother to put up her house for bail and I was out.
I had this feeling I would be killed right outside the jail.
I knew Paulie was pissed at me and he's such a hothead.
And I was worried about Jimmy.
Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he was in the drug deals with me...
...Paulie would have Jimmy whacked even before me.
This is the bad time.
I didn't feel safe until I got home.
Now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope...
...the cops never found, then disappear until things got straightened out.
Fuck!
Where's the stuff I left, Karen?
I flushed it down the toilet.
What?!
What was I supposed to do?!
That was worth $ !
I need that money!
That's all we got!
They had a search warrant!
That's all the money we had!
I was depending on that!
Why did you do that?!
I had to!
They were going to find it!
They wouldn't have found it!
They would have!
I swear!
They would've found it!
Why did you do that?!
They would have found it.
Why did you do that?
Oh, my God!
I had to do it.
Paulie, I'm really sorry.
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.
Yeah, you fucked up.
But I'm all right now.
I can be trusted now.
I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.
You looked me in the eyes and lied to me.
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.
After what you said, I couldn't come to you.
You know, I was ashamed.
I'm ashamed now.
But I got nowhere else to go.
You're all I got.
And I really, really need your help.
I really do.
Take this.
And now I must turn my back on you.
Thirty-two hundred bucks.
That's what he gave me.
bucks for a lifetime.
It wasn't even enough to buy a coffin.
We got to get out.
I don't want to run.
Am I supposed to pick up and leave everything?
Go hiding?
I don't want to do that.
If we stay around here we're dead.
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
What kind of questions they been asking?
I don't know.
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money...
...the girls are old enough to read newspapers.
Tell him to call me.
As soon as you talk to him tell him to call me.
It's important.
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
Take this.
It's a couple thousand.
Everything will be all right.
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
Take some for yourself.
For my mom.
Yeah, whatever.
Not here.
In the store on the corner.
It's swag, so I got it down the corner.
I'll see you.
Thanks.
Don't worry.
I'll try.
He's got to call me.
Over here?
Down here.
It's right there.
Right there.
Go ahead!
It's right there.
No, Jimmy.
I'm in a hurry.
My mom's watching the kids.
I got to get home.
I'll come back later.
What happened?
Nothing.
What happened?
I just got scared.
Got the keys?
What happened?
I just got scared.
It's okay.
You all right?
If you're part of a crew nobody tells you they're going to kill you.
It doesn't happen that way.
There aren't any arguments or curses like in the movies.
Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.
People who cared for you all your life.
They always seem to come when you're weakest and most in need of their help.
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place we both knew.
I got there minutes early and Jimmy was already there.
He took a booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up.
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.
He was jumpy.
He hadn't touched a thing.
On the surface, everything was supposed to be fine.
We were supposed to discuss my case.
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.
I been telling you your whole life, don't talk on the phone.
Now you understand?
It'll be all right.
You got a good chance to beat this case.
Well, you know that kid from the city we're talking about?
You know?
The kid turned out to be a rat.
As soon as he got pinched he ratted on everybody.
I know where he is.
He's hiding out.
Know what I'm saying?
Would you have a problem going with Anthony to take care of that?
No, not at all.
That way they got nothing.
Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before.
But now he's asking me to go to Florida and do a hit with Anthony.
That's when I knew I would never have come back from Florida alive.
Wherever you move me, I asked once and I tell you again...
...I don't want to go any place cold.
You don't have a choice.
Come on.
Whoever fucking controls it...
...just no place cold.
Do that for me.
He's bronchial, that's why.
If he's bronchial we'll consider that.
I'd like to go someplace not cold.
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?
What about them?
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?
Will I have some contact with them?
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me...
...if something happens to my parents and they get sick, I can't see them?
Maybe something can be worked out if they're sick.
If there's extraordinary circumstances...
I can't do this.
I can't do this, Henry.
I can't leave my parents.
Karen, I told you before.
I'm not going to do this unless you and the kids come with me.
I can't do it without you.
So you do whatever, but...
that's it.
You need Henry, not me, right?
That's right.
I don't care whether you go or not.
If it'll make him a better witness, I want you with him.
They don't want me.
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.
They can only get to him by getting to you or your kids.
If he goes into the program you're in danger.
I don't know anything.
Don't give me...
...the babes-in-the-wood routine.
I've listened to those wiretaps and I've heard you talk about cocaine.
Conversation after conversation you talk to Henry on the phone.
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...
...or stays on the streets, he's a dead man.
He knows it and you know it.
What about the kids and school?
I mean, what goes on?
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.
Whoever sold you those suits had a sense of humor.
What it comes down to is we're your only salvation.
We'll save your life, his life, and we'll keep you out of jail.
This morning you told the jury about your background.
It was easy for us to disappear.
My house was in my mother-in-law's name.
My cars were registered to my wife.
My Social Security cards and driver's licenses were phonies.
I never voted or paid taxes.
My birth certificate and arrest sheet were all that showed I was alive.
Do you see him here in this courtroom?
Will you point him out for the jury?
Let the record show that Mr Hill identified the defendant James Conway.
Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?
Do you see him in the courtroom?
Can you point him out for the jury?
Let the record show Mr Hill identified the defendant Paul Cicero.
I have a document...
The hardest thing was to leave the life.
I love the life.
We were treated like movie stars with muscle.
We had it all.
Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along.
I had bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen.
I had a bowl of coke next to the bed.
People call them rats because they will do anything to survive.
Objection!
Objection sustained.
I know nothing about being a rat.
You know everything about it!
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.
Free cars.
Keys to a dozen hideouts all over the city.
I'd bet grand over a weekend...
...then blow the winnings in a week or go to sharks to pay the bookies.
Didn't matter.
It didn't mean anything.
When I was broke I would go rob some more.
We ran everything.
We paid off cops.
We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.
And now it's all over.
That's the hardest part.
Today everything is different.
There's no action.
I have to wait around like everyone else.
Can't even get decent food.
After I got here I ordered spaghetti with marinara sauce...
...and I got egg noodles with ketchup.
Lunch time.
The longer you animals bark the colder your lunch gets. Come on, move it out! You too down there. Hey turkey...
"You schmuck. Do you really think I'd be stupid enough to kill myself?" Kill myself?
Come on!
Here he comes.
Francis, it's the lock. The lock, Francis.
Let go of the handle.
I don't have the handle. Open the lock!
Jake, up!
No.
Come on. Move...
It's open.
Get down! Come on!
Thanks Mama.
Okay you guys, let's try the victory pyramid. Okay so...alright... Let's work on this next move. We can do it. Next row, come on, put your arms up, put your arms up... smile...good. You got it!
Turn that TV off son, I can't hear myself think.
Yeah right, dad.
Huh?
The water going down son?
Uh...no.
Going down now?
Sorry, kid.
Oh wow...a police chase! With bullets!! Ah, shit!
What the hell are we doing here?
Ah, trust in your old mother boys. Throw it into four wheel drive and hold onto your hats.
Welcome to the third annual ORV rally. Are you ready to go?...Go!
Oh, bummer. Nothing exciting ever happens around here anyway. Who needs the Goondocks? Who needs this house? I can't wait to get outta here.
Really?
Nah, I was just trying to delate myself. No, no...y'know, um, uh, dic..dictate myself.
That's delude yourself, dummy.
That's what I said. Thanks, Brand.
I know how you feel, wimp. I'm sure going to miss this place too.
Adopted wuss.
Adopted wuss...I'm no adopted wuss. I'll kill you, Brand!
Oh, it's Mouth.
Hey, Meekey. Yo Mikey. Eh, Mikey, seen Adrian? Hey guys, what's going down? .
Get your foot off the table, Mouth.
You got it. What's going down guys? Hey, what's the matter with you guys? Come on? What's the matter? What is this, a nuclear Saturday or something? Come on, guys. This is our last weekend together, last "Goonie" weekend. We got to be goin' out in style, cruisin' the coast, sniffin' some lace, downin' some brews...but nooo. The one older brother had to go and screw it up, by flunking your driver's test? Don't know what to do with ya, kid.
Hey guys, I just got the best...you're not gonna believe. Hey you guys, you gotta let me in.
Jerk alert! It's Chunk.
I'm not lyin'. I just saw the most amazing thing in my entire life.
First you gotta do the Truffle Shuffle.
Come on...
Do it.
Come on...
Do it!
Cut it out, Mouth.
Oh guys, guys, thanks a lot. You guys, you're not going to believe me. This time I'm telling the truth.
You turd!
Feed the fish, Mikey.
You flunked your driver's test?
Shut up, Mouth.
Listen, okay. You guys will never believe me. There was two cop cars, okay. And they were chasing this four wheel deal, it was this real neat ORV, and there were bullets flying all over the place. It was the most amazing thing I ever saw!
More amazing than the time Michael Jackson came over to your house to use the bathroom?
More amazing than the time you saved those old people from that nursing home fire, right?
Yeah, and I bet it was even more amazing than the time you ate your weight in Godfather's Pizza, right?
Okay Brand, Michael Jackson didn't come over to my house, to use the bathroom. But his sister did!
Okay Data, don't mess this one up, and prepare for the Wings of Flight.
Uh oh! Screen door! Open the screen door!
Mikey! The screen door!
Chunk!
Hey, I bet you guys thought I was going to drop it, huh? Ha ha. . I knew you would think that from good old Chunk.
Oh my God!
You idiot!
Look, it's not broken. It's perfect. Ha ha.
Oh my God.
What?
That's my mom's most favorite piece.
What?
Ooooh.
Oh my God.
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
Shut up, Mouth.
Shut up, Mouth.
Hey, any of you guys ever hear of Detroit?
No.
Soitenly. That's where Motown started. It's also got the highest murder rate in the country.
Well let me tell you what. That's where we're moving when we lose our house tomorrow.
You shut up about that stuff. It'll never happen. My dad'll fix it.
Yeah, sure he will. If he gets his next four hundred paychecks by tomorrow afternoon.
That's wrong Brand. It won't happen!
Oh...hi Mom!
Hi Mom.
Hi, hi.
I see Data dropped by.
Hi, Mrs. Walsh, how are you?
Hi Mrs. Walsh.
Boys, this is Rosalita. Rosalita's going to help us with the packing just until my arm is better.
Olé!
Hola!
Uh, boys, Rosalita doesn't speak a word of English, and I know some of you have taken some Spanish in school...
Well, Mrs. Walsh, I speak perfect Spanish. And if it's any help to you I'd be glad to communicate with Rosalita.
You're a lifesaver Clarke. Come with us, will you?
Why certainly, Mrs. Walsh.
Mikey, no more potato chips. I've told you... Hello Mikey honey...
It's Brand, Ma.
Do you think your Mom's going to notice?
What?!
Do you think your Mom's going to notice...notice that the dick and balls are missing?
I wonder if she'll notice.
That's what I said!
Of course she'll notice. She notices everything.
Pants and shirts are in the second. Jus..just throw them all into cardboard boxes. Forget the suitcases. Clarke, can you translate that?
Why certainly, Mrs. Walsh.
Oh, that's wonderful, simply wonderful.
Translation: Marijuana goes in the top drawer. Cocaine and Speed in the second, the Heroin in the bottom. Always separate the drugs.
Look. How's that? How's that?
Oh you idiot. You glued it on up-side-down.
You dork. If God made us do it that way you'd all be pissing in your faces.
Looks fine to me.
Now Rosalita, this is the attic. Mr. Walsh doesn't like anybody up here, ever. I guess that's why it's always open.
Never go up there. It's filled with Mr. Walsh's Sexual Torture Devices.
This is my supply closet. You'll find everything you need: brooms, dustpans, insect spray... I would really like the house clean when they tear it down. Clarke, can you translate?
If you do a bad job you'll be locked in here with the cockroaches for two weeks without food or water.
Okay, Rosie? Okay? You're going to be very happy here. Come on Clarke, we've got much more to do. You're so fluent in languages.
I am in a crazy house.
You are so fluent in Spanish. That was so nice of you.
"Nice" is my middle name, Mrs. Walsh.
Boys, I'm taking Rosalita to the supermarket. Now listen...
Hi, Mrs. Walsh.
...I'm going to be back in about an hour. Mikey, I want you kept inside. Brand, if he's coming down with asthma I don't want him out in the rain.
He should be put in a plastic bubble.
I'm serious Brandon. That's not funny. He takes one step outside and you are in deep, absolutely the deepest...
"Shit", Ma.
I don't like that language, but that's exactly what you're going to be in. And you, Dotta...
Data.
...Data, use the back door from now on, okay?
Alright.
What is that?
Ah shit. What?
What is that?! That is a mess! I want it cleaned up boys.
Oh yeah, sure.
You got it.
One hour, kids, and I'll be back. Bye baby. Rosie?
Bye, Mrs. Walsh.
Bye.
Bye Mom.
Adios, Señorita!
You want a breathing problem? You've got one.
Hey guys... what's your dad going to do with all that stuff that's in the attic?
He's going to give it back to the museum, or whoever they pick to be the new assistant curly, or kerney...
Curator.
That's what I said.
Hey, wait a minute guys. Maybe there's some stuff up there for us. Maybe there's some stuff that we can keep from the oldsiders. Maybe there's some rich stuff.
No, no, you guys.
Food! Lots of food.
That's my dad's responsibility, you guys. The museum's probably got a list of it somewhere. You guys listen to me, damn it. That's his stuff.
Hey, look at this. I didn't know Dad had all this stuff up here.
Ah, great. Look at that. Neato.
Love it. Isn't this great? I like this stuff!
Hey, come on guys. This is my dad's place. He doesn't want you up here. You heard what my mom said to the housekeeper about not wanting anybody up here...
Mikey, I cannot believe that you actually have something this cool in your house.
You guys, my mom said...you guys, stop, put down the outfit, okay?
Hey Mikey, this is great. We only have old Hanukkah decorations in our attic.
I don't care what you have in your attic.
Okay guys, you saw it. Now let's get out of here, okay?
Come on, Mikey, let's stay a little.
Scared, Mikey?
I gotcha right were I want ya.
Ouch. Come on guys, it's dusty in here, my hayfever's acting up, and you always break something.
Meekey...
What?
Meekey, come here and make me feel like a woman. Come on, give me a nice, wet lickery kiss.
Yeah, what is it? Data, look at this.
That's neat.
Gotcha! Now get out from behind there. You're ruining the painting...
You're ruining my joke! The painting's already trash.
Man, you're messing this up.
Who cares?
I told you not to touch it. Get off it, alright?
Hey, Mikey? Mikey?
What?
What is all this neat stuff?
The museum did some kind of... They did a show. It was a retropakum, and it was a...
Retrospective.
That's what I said. You always contradict me. I was right. I knew what...it was about the history of Astoria, and, these are the rejects.
Kind of like us, Mike, the Goonies.
How did you turn that on?...Turn it off...
Yeah.
I'm not a reject.
Take that stuff off. You're going to get me in trouble.
You know, you know how this works? Watch, if you put one finger there...
Neat. Laser beams!
Mouth, when you drop something, put it back up.
What's this? Hey, wait a sec. Chunk...
I didn't touch it.
I know you didn't touch it. Get over here.
Don't touch it, Chunk.
Uh, hold this.
Why me, Mike? Mike, Mike, thanks for taking us up here...there's a real big ball, you know...
Five...four...three...two...one.
...and it's got this big thing...
What are you doing?
Hey, Mike found a map.
Is that a map?
Yeah.
Look, look, look. That says 1632.
I've seen this before.
Is that a year or something?
No, it's your top score on Pole Position.
Yes, it's a year, Chunk. Look Data, it's a map of our coastline.
What's all that Spanish junk right there?
Uh...
Who speaks Spanish? Mouth, Mouth, you said you could translate. Translate, right here.
Yeah, translate it.
Ye intruders beware. Crushing death and grief, soaked with blood, of the trespassing thief.
You guys, this map is old news. Everybody and their Grandfather went looking for that, when our parents were our age. I mean, I mean, haven't you ever heard of that guy, what's his name, uh, the pirate guy, One-eyed Willy?
Oh yeahOne-eyed Willy... One-eyed Willy, yeah, he was the most famous pirate in his time. My dad told me all about him once.
Dad'll do anything to get you to go to sleep.
No, see, One-eyed Willy stole a treasure once. It was full of rubies, and emeralds, and...
Diamonds?
...diamonds. Then he loaded it all up on to his ship and they sailed away into the sunset. Until the British King, see, he found out about it and then he set up this whole armada to go out after him, then the armada, they...it took em a couple weeks, but then they caught up with Willy, and, and, then there was a whole, big war between the armada and Willy's ship, the Inferno, and during the firefight there was these guns bursting here and cannons bursting there, and then Willy fled, 'cause he didn't want to stay around, 'cause he knew he'd get killed if he stayed around. And then he got into this cave, and the British, they blew up the walls all around him, and he got caved in, and he's been there ever since.
Forever?
Forever.
And ever?
Trapped.
Wow!
You sound just as corny as Dad does.
My Dad tells me the truth. You know what he said?
What?
He told me that One-eyed Willy and his bunch were down there for five, six years. And they were digging all these tunnels, and caves...setting boody traps...
Booby traps.
That's what I said. Setting booby traps, so that anybody who tried to get in there would die. And then do you know what he did? He killed all of his men.
Why?
Why'd he kill all of them?
Because he didn't want them to get to his treasure.
Yeah, wait a minute, Mikey. But if he killed all his men, how did the map or the story get out?
See, I asked my dad the same question. He said one of the guys must have gotten out with the map, and, and the...
Hey Mike, I believe ya.
Yeah, well I don't believe ya. I don't believe ya at all. I think you're full of it. I think...
I believe him.
Your dad told me...
Chunk? What'd you break this time Chunk?
Hey, you guys, look at this. Hey, you guys ever heard of this guy? Look, Chester Copperpot?
Chester Copperpot?
Okay it says, "Chester Copperpot: Missing while in pursuit of local legend. Reclusive scavenger claims, 'I have the key to One-eyed Willy'."
Whoa, do you guys realize what we could do?
Nobody ever found nothing, you guys. I mean, why do you think this map would be up here in this attic when it could be in some safety deposit box somewhere, right?
That's right. And anyway, if Chester Copperpot didn't find it, how would we find it?
But, what if? You guys, just what if this map could lead to One-eyed Willy's rich stuff?
Maybe.
Then we wouldn't have to leave the Goondocks. Come on.
I don't wanna leave.
I don't wanna go on any more of your crazy Goonie adventures.
Ding dong.
Guys, come on. Where are you going? You don't wanna do this? Sixteen thirty-two.
Senior Jerk alert.
Can I help you?
Hello, little guys. I'm Mr. Perkins, Troy's father.
We know who Troy is. He's such a cheap guy.
Shut up. My Dad's not home, Mr. Perkins.
Is your mommy here?
No sir, actually she's down at the market buying Pampers for all us kids.
Papers, Bill. You can give these papers your father to, uh, read through, and sign.
We'll be by to pick them up in the morning.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Brand, what is all that stuff?
It's Dad's business.
But what is it?
I told you, it was Dad's business.
Look at 'em smiling.
They can't wait until tomorrow when they foreclose on all the...whatever you call it.
Trash the Goondocks.
When they wreck our house I hope they make it a sandtrap.
And never get their balls out!
You know, I think they made me lose my appetite.
Mikey? Come on, before you catch a real cold.
You seem to be pretty sure of yourself.
The foreclosure is a definite.
Oh God, am I depressed.
If I found One-eyed Willy's rich stuff I'd pay all my Dad's bills. Then maybe he could get to sleep at night, instead of sitting up trying to figure out a way for all of us to stay here.
Yeah, me too.
Me three.
Me four.
Forget about any adventures, limp-lungs. I let you out and Mom'll ground my ass and I've got a date with Andi on Friday, alright?
You're dreaming dude. There's no way, 'cause that means her mom's gotta drive. Then you gotta make it with her and her mom.
Shut up, Mouth.
Shut up, Mouth.
Shut up, Data.
Guys, what are we going to do about that Country Club? It's killing our parents. If we don't do something now there's going to be a golf course right where we're standing.
Hey Brand, how far can you stretch that?
It's not that hard.
Go guys.
Get off me, Chunk. Get off. Get off me.
I got you. I got you.
What are you doing? It took him 376 lawnmower jobs to pay for that. It's his most favorite thing in the world.
Now it's his most flattest thing in the world. Let's go!
I'm going to hit you so hard when you wake up your clothes are going to be out of style. Hey! Mikey!
Oh, Ma. Mom, you gotta let me out of here. Ma. Mom...
Can't you learn how to exercise like a normal kid?
But Ma...
Look at you. You're hyper-ventrilocating here. Where's your brother?
Mom! God, what's wrong with you people? Rosalita, come here. Wait, you gotta let me outta here. Rosalita?
Rosalita, wait. Come here. Come here. Come here. You gotta let me outta here. Rosa...wait...
Brandon, don't you come home without your brother, or I'll commit hare...Hare Krishna!
That's "Hara-Kari," Ma.
That's exactly what I said.
What? My new tires! They popped my new tires, those son-of-a...I'm gonna... Sorry.
My bike! My bike!
I owe you one.
I want my bike. I want my bike.
Hi Mr. Walsh.
Uh huh.
Hi Mr. Walsh.
Hi Mikey.
Hi Dad.
Hey guys, wait for me.
That's where we're going. Right around this next curve is Gold Rock Beach. Three rocks, I know it. I've got a feeling about this one.
You always have a feeling, Mikey. Every time you have a feeling you get us in trouble.
Get us in trouble? You're the one who always gets us in trouble, Double-oh Negative.
I'm James Bond - 007, not Double-oh Negative.
You guys, I'm hungry. I know when my stomach growls there's trouble.
Shut up, Chunk!
Hey, you make me go up this big hill, and you said, you said you'd give me a Twinkie. Now I'm gonna be late for dinner and my mom's gonna yell at me. And she's not gonna let me eat my dinner and she's gonna punish me. Ah, you guys, ah. Anybody got a candybar? Baby Ruth?
Troy! You touch that mirror again and I swear to God I'm going to smack you in the face.
Hey, there's Brand.
Oh, like the bike.
What is he doing?
No wonder he can't get a license.
Oh, no.
Brand, can we give you a ride somewhere?
Huh?
No. Thanks anyway, though.
Yeah Walsh, let us give you a little ride.
Hey!
Hold on. Here we go.
Hey! Let go of my hand! Troy!
Troy, you're gonna kill him!
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh my God!
So long, sucker!
Ahhh!!!!
Forget it.
Come on. This better be it, Mikey.
Shut up, Chunk.
Guys...I think I have a match. I'm sure of it! The lighthouse, the rock, and the restaurant all fit the doubloon. That must mean that the rich stuff is near the restaurant. So, , wait a second, Mouth, I'm going to need you to translate the map because I don't understand Spanish. Right here.
Alright, alright, alright.
What does that mean?
Ten times ten.
Uh, hundred.
Hundred.
...stretching feet to nearest northern point.
North. What's north? Which way is north?
That's where you'll find the treat.
The treat...the rich stuff! The treat! The rich stuff. That's it!
North is that way.
So, it's near the restaurant.
Wait a minute, guys. There's somebody there.
Sixty and another forty is an even one hundred, right to the old restaurant. The rich stuff has gotta be there.
I don't know about it Mikey. Hey, it's gettin' late, and hey, that's a summer place. What's it doing open in the fall?
See, there's nothing to be scared of. See, there's already two customers who went inside the restaurant.
Yeah, yeah, but what if they're not customers? What if they're drug dealers?
Drug dealers? Shit man. Did you see their clothes? Drug dealers wouldn't be caught dead in those polyester rags.
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey. That sounded like gunshots. Not the big ones that you hear in war movies, but gunshots, real ones. They're trying to kill us!
Geez Chunk. Turn off your brain, alright? Someone probably dropped a pot.
Yeah.
Yeah, just dropped a pot.
Ah, ah, are you sure, Mikey? Because if you're sure I'm sure, you know. They might pick up the pots, and they might try to kill us. They're gonna kill us! In fact...
Chunk...shut up!
Soda pop! Oh boy, am I thirsty. Damn it!
What's that?
Come on. Hurry up, hurry up...Francis...
Looks like the cook is carrying something to the kitchen, or something.
Yeah, food. Looks like food or some kind of trash.
Don't let them see us, guys.
ORV...bullet holes...bullet holes!
Shhh!!!
Shut up, Chunk!
This place is a summer restaurant? Looks like it hasn't been open for ten summers.
How long you boys been at that window?
Long enough to see you need about four hundred roach motels in this place.
How the hell am I supposed to create with that Smithsonian piece of shi..?
Jake, these boys are customers.
Eh, boys, uh? You make yourselves comfortable, uh? She's going to cook you something.
What do you want?
A glass of water.
Water, water.
Four waters. Is that all?
Yeah.
Yes, yes.
No! I want the Veal Scallopine...
Mouth...shut up!
...I want the Fettucini Alfredo...a bottle of Fettucini, a 1981.
The only thing we serve is tongue.
You boys like tongue? Ha ha ha ha, a ha ha ha. That all? Sit down!
You alright, Chunk? Hey guys...
I know...I know...
What happened to the two guys in the polyester suits that came before us? What happened to them?
I know.
What, what is it? Spit it out.
... hostage crisis. Out in the garage, O..ORV, four wheel drive, bullet holes the size of... Matzah Balls!
Chunk, I'm starting to O.D. on all your bullshit stories.
Yeah.
Shut up.
There's your water!
Thank you, Sir, uh, Ma'am.
Thank you, Sir... Oh, I mean, Ma'am.
This' supposed to be water?
It's wet, ain't it? Drink it!
Miss, where's the men's room, please?
Can't you hold it?
No.
Mikey, Mikey, this ain't the kind of place you wanna go to the bathroom in it.
Why not?
Because, they might have daddy long legs in 'em... ...or dead things Mikey! Dead things.
Eh, Mikey...got to go to the bathroom?
Killer dead things...big...mean...
Lady, please!
Downstairs, first door on the right.
Thank you.
Mikey, come on...
Stay to the right!
Yes Ma'am.
Please Mikey, dead things!
Stay to the right!
I know, "Stay to the right." Thank you.
I know you're down here, One-eyed Willy. You gotta be down here. I can feel it, One-eyed Willy. I know you're down here. Oh man, that stinks! What the hell was that?
You're ruinin' it. You're ruinin' it. See the feast I made ya? Look at the feast I made ya. You wanna eat it? Here, have some.
Come on. Go ahead, you'll get something. You don't leave me any choice.
You don't leave me any choice! You're just like Mom and Francis. You never let me finish anything.
Please!!!
Food! Ah! Ah! Hungry! Hungry! Food, please!
Mikey, why can't you stay at home. Let's get out of here right now. Let's get out of here.
Get out of here! And stay out! Kids suck.
I swear on my life, they've got...an 'It', a giant 'It'.
Ooh.
They got it chained to the wall.
Come on, Mikey.
When it came into the light it was all gross and distorted, , and the parts were mixed around.
Like your brain, right Lamo? Say goodbye to your little pals.
Hey look! Look at that.
Mom, why'd you have to shoot the guy?
He's a fed.
We could have taken him to the side of the road, in the car, and 'bing', we shoot him, in the brain.
Just put it in the car.
Bring him over here, Francis.
Don't give me, "Over here..."
Mama, give me over here...
I'm the one who's always gotta...
You gotta what?
You know, I'm wondering what is in the bag.
Ah, restaurant trash. Yeah.
You sure?
Positive.
That big? That much?
I'm positive. Yeah.
Look, there were bullet holes in the car, this big. Mikey, Mikey, come on. Our parents are worried, it's dinnertime.
Yeah.
Why don't we go home?
Home? What home? In a couple more hours it ain't going to be home any more. Come on, guys, this is our time, our last chance to see if there really is any rich stuff.
We got to.
Duck down guys. Get down. Get down. Duck down!
See, there are bullet holes in the back of that thing!
Ah shit!
You scared me!
Almost gave me a heart attack.
Hey Mouth, you look better from behind.
Hey, wanna see something really scary? Look at that.
That is so scary.
...and ugly!
We followed you guys...
You did?
We were out driving with Troy... Ooh, sorry about your face.
Oh, don't worry about it. I was born with it.
Just kiddin'.
Anyway, he was being such a jerk, you know, tiltin' the mirror so he could look down my shirt? So I elbowed his lip.
You elbowed his lip?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's locked.
Thank God!
Hey, wait a minute, Chunk.
What?
You know I got some naked pictures of your mom, taking a bath. Wanna buy 'em?
What?!
Real cheap!
Aaah!
Thanks, Chunk.
Thanks, Chunk.
You wait here one second, okay? I'll be right back. I'm gonna go get my brother, alright?
You guys are gonna get in trouble.
Just don't leave, alright?
No way.
I'm not staying here.
I'm not staying.
Shut up! We've got to get to the lowest point of the floor.
Lowest point nothing, Mikey! Let's go. Now!
Waaa!
Aaah! My God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
No, Brand.
Mikey!
Turn on the lights.
Oh, my God.
Oh my God.
It was disgusting, you should have seen it.
It jumped out from the bushes. It almost killed us, I swear to God.
Come on, Brand, please?
Yeah.
What if we find something, huh? A couple more minutes isn't going to hurt.
Come on, Mikey. We're going right now!
No.
Listen to your big brother.
Hey Brand, give him a few minutes. ...as long as you stay here, with me.
Wait.
Listen to her; she knows what she's talking about.
Yeah, she does.
Yeah.
Yeah, listen to her.
Let's go!
Aaah!
Chunk, I hope that was your stomach.
No. That's the "It".
Sounds like Kong.
Part of it's human. Wanna see it? Don't worry. It's chained to the wall. Shhh!
I don't wanna go, Mikey. I don't wanna go. I just...
Why not? It's chained to the wall.
I know it's chained to the wall, right?
Come on...you wanted to go, didn't ya.
Yeah, I wanted to go. I wanted to go...
So let's go.
I don't want to see it.
Shame, shame.
We know your name.
Come on, Brand, slip her the tongue!
That's disgusting. No, I can't even look. Oh...can't...oh...that's sick. That really is sick.
Get me up, guys!
One..two..three.
Thanks, guys.
You're welcome.
Can't you smell it, guys? One-eyed Willy really is down here.
That's great. You know, you guys? I'm gonna build one like this.
Alright, we're walking right above here.
Water!
Okay, come on. We can do it.
Ow! Wait a minute. No...
...back, and the stairs go up, and right about here must have been where we said we got to get to the lowest spot.
What are you doing talking to yourself again, Mikey? Ow!
Sorry.
What the hell are you doing?
Mikey, you're gonna lose your filling.
Mikey, what are you doing? You little...
Brand.
Give me that. There's nothing buried under there.
There is something buried under there, Josh.
This is the twentieth century, Mikey.
The map says there's something buried under there. There's gotta be.
Come on, get off it.
Look it! I've got an idea. Why don't we just pour chocolate all over the floor, , and let Chunk eat his way through?
Okay Mouth, that's all I can stand. And I can't stand no more!
I got it. I got it. I got it!
I don't got it.
You klutz.
Hope it's not a deposit bottle.
This is ridiculous. It's crazy. I feel like I'm babysitting, except I'm not getting paid.
Wait. Listen to that.
What?
So what?
Sounds like my grandfather taking a leak, Mikey. Grossout.
No. No, it's deep. Like there's a hole, or a passageway. It's real deep.
Get out of the way.
Brand is being so sweet to me.
Oh, come on. Come on! Where are you? You're in the clouds and we are in a basement!
I told you! Ha ha! Told you. I told you. One..two..three...
You can feel the air. There's something down there.
See I told you there was something.
It might be a treasure or something.
Hey, this is working, guys.
Brand, careful!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I told you there was a passageway.
It's the start of the tunnel.
Look.
Fifty dollar bills. Fifty dollar bills. Fifty dollar bills. Fifty dollar bill!!
Did he say "Fifty dollar bills?"
Fifty dollar bill!! Guys, there's hundreds of fifty dollar bill! We have the money to save the Goondocks!
Billions of them.
Hey guys, they're real.
Quiet!
What? What? What?
They're fake. They're bogus.
No it's not.
They're phony. They're phony bills.
No, it's not.
I knew these people were from the ozone.
No.
You get twenty-five years for counterfeiting.
Oooh!
You guys, I recognize these people.
Look at it. It's the Fratellis.
That's the guy from upstairs.
And the guy who tried to sing.
See, you guys, you never listen to me. I said that there was going to be trouble, but you didn't listen to me. You guys are crazy. You know, you guys are self-destructive. There's a funny farm and it has your names written all over it, but I'm gettin' outta here. Tha... I smell ice cream. Chunk: They got Swensons! Oh look, they got "Pralines 'n Cream," and they got "Mississippi Mud," and they got "Chocolate Eruption!" and they got, "Apple," oh, and they got, "Grape"... They got Grape, and Super-Duper Chocolate Eruption, and... Wha? Wha? Aaaah!
Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! It's a stiff!
It's the door.
Somebody's been here. The door's broken.
I thought I shut it. Who left the lights on?
You did.
Pizza?
Shhh!
Pepperoni?
Shhh!
Ma, he's eating my pepperoni.
You want your pepperoni? Huh?
Come on. Come on. Let's kill each other over the pepperoni.
Jake, put that gun away! I said, put that gun away now!
You always take his side, Mom. You always liked him better than me.
That's right!
Put it back.
Close the door.
We can go back...Mikey...Mikey.
Mikey, come on.
The fireplace, Brand. It's the only way out. You guys'll never get out that way.
What?
It all starts here.
Watch your foot.
Huh?
Guys! I'm stuck with the stiff! He's in here. Stay! Stay! Guys, come here. He's in here. Oh, shit!
Come on, let's go. Go Andi, go.
Go?
Alright Jake, forget it.
I'm sorry.
Help! Help! Help! Guys!
Come on, you idiots!
Okay, Mom.
Make sure it's safe.
It's safe.
Hurry up!
This is for real! I'm not kidding! Look in the window!
Come on.
Where's Chunk?
Chunk's up there.
I don't want him to touch that. I worked two hours on that.
You worked what...
Shut up! Somebody's been here. The cooler's broken.
Probably a tremor.
Go check your brother.
Well, well, it could've been a tremor, Ma.
I'll show you a tremor!
Ooh! I'm going to go check my brother.
He better not have broken those chains again. I'm not going back to the zoo for another set.
Ma, just don't upset him.
Hurry up!
Gesundheit.
It's cold.
Chunk.
Huh?
Chunk, over here.
Get over here!
What are you guys doing down there?
Go get the police.
Chunk, we're in some serious shit here. You've gotta get the police. Look behind you.
Oh, the window. Go out the window.
Did you see him, guys?
Wait a minute. Where's Chunk?
He went to go to the police.
The Fratellis are there. We gotta go. Come on, guys.
Let's go.
He's going to get the police. Go. Move. Move.
There's nothing the matter with him; nothing to worry about.
Aaah. I knew he couldn't break them chains. Come on, get the body.
We've been walking forever. How much further do you plan on going?
Ow! Mouth, you stepped on my foot. I dropped my glasses; I can't see a thing. Oh my God.
I found your glasses. Sorry.
You broke my glasses. You broke my glasses! Oh.
Listen, guys. Listen, guys. I'm the oldest, so I'm in charge. First, we'll...
Data?
What?
Do you have a light?
I said I was in charge. Do you have a light?
A light... sure, guys! Back up. Back up. Bully Blinders!
Alright. Ow!
You know, one day when I was walking home with this thing, and a couple big guys stopped me...
Who is it? Oh, Stef...watch out, Data.
Watch out.
Data, come on. Turn it off.
Oh, Data. Only problem is batteries don't last so long, guys. Oh.
Guys, there's a light up ahead. Maybe we can get out that way. Let's go.
I'm not afraid of the dark. I like the dark. I love the dark, but I hate nature. I hate nature.
Wait a sec! Hold on!
Stop! Hold it! I'm just a kid!
What seems to be the problem?
Look, mister, I need a ride. My friends and I just had a run-in with these really disgusting people; you might have heard of them: the Fratellis. Well, we found their hideout, and could you please, please take me to the sheriff station. I can describe all three of 'em.
Bur...uh...ta...
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
What the hell are you doing? He's only a kid. Can't you handle a kid, even?
Aaaah!
A lantern. Hey you guys, it's a lantern! Does it work, guys?
Don't worry about it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
I can't see anything. Mouth, your father's a plumber. What are these pipes all about?
These look like water pipes, guys. Gas pipes...drainage... Maybe...wait a minute, guys! Shut up for a minute. Okay, lookit. These pipes must lead to a building or something, a foundation. So maybe if bang on 'em hard enough, if we make enough noise...
Reverse Pressure!
Daddy!
Lets...
Get outta...
Here!
Like, now!
Go! Go! Go!
First we start with the fleshy little fingers, then the plump little hand. Then the fleshy arm... Now, tell me where your other little friends are.
The fireplace.
Don't lie to me!
Honestly. We went over to Mikey's dad's place, and we found a map that said that underneath this place there's buried treasure.
Come on, don't give us none of your bullshit stories, huh.
Hey kid. I want you to spill your guts. Tell us everything.
Everything?
Everything!
Everything. Okay, I'll talk. In third grade I cheated on my history exam. In fourth grade I stole my Uncle Max's toupe and I glued it on my face when I played Moses in my Hebrew school play. In fifth grade I knocked my sister Edie down the stairs and I blamed it on the dog...
I can't see a thing. What am I stepping on? Oh brother.
A lantern! Look, you guys, a lantern! Somebody must have been here before us.
Maybe they're still here.
God, I hope not.
Look at these cigarettes.
Ten minutes ago...
Come on, Andi.
Troy was looking down my shirt. Who cares? There's nothing wrong with that, is there? If I wasn't so stupid he'd still be looking down my shirt.
You guys, listen to her.
What's the matter with her?
Andi...it's okay.
Is she alright?
It's okay. Andi? Andi?
Oh, I stubbed my toe.
Hey Andi!
Andi!
I should have let him look at my body. Don't I have a beautiful body? Don't I have a beautiful body?
You've got a great, a great body.
I have a beautiful body. How many more years do I have, before I, get old and fat; before, my hair falls out... ...before I look like him.
Brand!
Then my mom sent me to...to a summer camp for fat kids. And that was third lunch I got nuts and I pigged out, and they kicked me out.
Look at him.
Don't touch it guys. You guys, now...
This is one of your tricks, isn't it One-eyed Willy? You wouldn't have gone through all this trouble if you weren't really hiding something, would you?
I know. I know. So did I. It's okay. It's okay. There's nothing to worry about.
You don't know. You don't understand.
He's dead for sure. I think he's the Chester Copperpot.
Chester who?
Who?
Don't you guys remember? From the attic...the Don't you guys remember? From the attic...the news article.
Oh, the news article, right.
See, they said the last guy who went looking for the rich stuff...they say he went in, but he never came back out. See, that was back in nineteen thirty-five. Oh God, if he didn't make it out, and he was supposed to be an expert, what about us guys? How are we going to get out of here, huh?
Oh.
Don't worry about it. Just calm down.
You sure?
I'm positive.
You sure?
Positive.
How are we going to get out?
We can't be sure it's Chester Copperpot.
I know it's him. I know, I read the article.
I bet his ID's in his wallet. Mouth, get his wallet.
Lou Gerrig?
You get it, Mikey.
Mouth, come on.
Mikey, get it.
Get his wallet.
It is Chester Copperpot.
Oh God. Oh.
See? I told you.
We're gonna get killed, too.
Hey, look at this. Candles, a whole bunch of 'em.
Great! Let me have it. I'll put it in my pack.
Oh. He's dead.
He's dead?
Data, where are you going?
I'm setting boody traps.
Booby traps.
That's what I said. See, I'm setting booby traps in case of anybody's following us, like the Fratellis, so we can hear them coming.
Okay, hurry up.
Good idea.
Hey Data, where are you going?
I'm setting boody traps.
You mean booby traps.
That what I said, booby traps! Be quiet. Shh. God, these guys.
Guys. Guys, look at this. Look at this.
Yeah, give me that.
It looks like a skeleton of One-eyed Willy or something.
Give me that. Give me this thing.
Oh, man!
Don't touch that. Don't touch that.
Oh God. Oh my God, don't, don't, don't...
Hey guys, now that we've got...
Look at this. You see what I found?
Guys, freeze. Don't move. Don't move. You guys! Don't move back there! Don't move!
What?
Freeze.
Guys! Guys!
Let's go!
Run you guys! RUN!
Holy S-H-I-T!
The lantern!
Mikey come back!
That was close.
That was close.
Oh.
Wait, wait, wait, listen. Sounds like somebody's down there. Shut up and listen.
Maybe it's a way out.
Maybe it's the Fratellis.
Maybe Chunk found the police.
Maybe it's another one of Willy's booby traps.
Brand, God put that rock there for a purpose, and, um, and I'm not so sure you should, um, move iter thing.
Hello?
Guys! Guys! Back, back back.
Get 'em off me.
Brand. Andi. They're in my hair.
Rabies! Rabies! We're gonna get rabies!
Sit! Sit!
But the worst thing I ever done, I mixed up all this fake puke at home and then I went to this movie theatre, hid the puke in my jacket, climbed up to the balcony, and then, then I made a noise like this. Huagh. Huagh. Huagh. Huaaah! And, and then I dumped it over the side on all the people in the audience. Then, th-then then this was horrible, all the people started getting sick, and throwing up all over each other. I never felt so bad in my entire life.
Ma, I'm beginning to like this kid.
Hit puree!
No! I'm too young. No! I wanna play the violin. No, not my hand.
Now, do I get the truth...
Please.
Do I get the truth? Or do you get juice?
What was that noise?
The fireplace blew. The kid's not kidding, Ma, there's a tunnel down there.
Watch your hair! Watch your hair! They go for the hair!
Watch your face, Mom.
Hey Mikey, if you can hear me, run! Run! They're comin' after ya.
Hey, you guys, if we keep going this far down we'll reach China.
My feet are killing me. I can't see a thing.
Maybe I can visit my Auntie or something
Uh, this could get dangerous, Andi. You might want to hold my hand.
Thank you.
Oh, wow!
Oh, neat! That's neat.
You guys, look! It's a beautiful waterfall.
Wow!
Wow! It's a giant piggy bank.
We're rich! I don't believe it.
You guys, we found it. We found the gold!
Gold and silver! It's shining all over the place.
Gold! Guys, we did it!
Brand, hold the lantern for me.
Rich stuff!
Hey, Mouth, what year was that map made?
Oh, I don't know. Probably a couple hundred years before...
Oh, wow!
...uh, President Lincoln, , George Washington, , uh, Martin Sheen...
Martin Sheen?
That's President Kennedy, you idiot!
Well, same difference! I mean, he played Kennedy once.
Oh, that's really smart. I'm glad you know you're using your brain.
Yeah, well at least I have a brain!
So stupid, Mouth!
Oh yeah?
Yes! Shut up! Wait a minute, wait a minute. This isn't gold. This is a wishing well. Look. Look.
Hey, you guys, it must be the Old Mossgarden Wishing Well.
You know, I always used to believe that when you threw your money in, it turned into your wish.
You take that coin, and I'll take two coins. I'll take all your coins and you won't get any.
Hey, that's not fair.
Wait, wait, wait. Stop. Stop.
Why?
You can't do this.
Why?
Why?
Because, these are somebody else's wishes. They're somebody else's dreams.
Yeah, but you know what? This one, this one right here, this was my dream, my wish, and it didn't come true. So I'm takin' it back. I'm takin' 'em all back.
Come on, One-eyed Willy, what does this have to do with the map? Is this just another one of your tricks?
You know, maybe we should keep him alive, just in case, uh, he isn't lying.
Good idea, Jake. Put him in with your brother.
Okay, Mom. Come on, kid.
You drop something?
What's that?
Aaah!
What's that? A Cracker-Jack prize?
Holy shit!
We found it on the map. It's got something to do with the buried treasure.
Buried treasure?
Jake, look at this. Look at the date. Look at the date on it.
This is authentic. Ma, this is a doubloon.
Give it to me. Aaagh.
I told you so. See, you guys, you never believe me. But I said that there was going to be buried...
Hey Troy, how far you gone with Andi?
All the way, buddy?
You guys are so immature. Why don't you grow up?
Come on, tell us.
Really.
Alright, put it this way. I didn't make it with her yet...and I stress yet.
Huh? What the hell?
What'd you wish for?
To make it with Andi.
Hey! Who's down there?
It's Troy.
Hey guys, it's Troy!
Troy!
That sounds like Andi.
Andi... Is that you?
Yes Troy, it's me. We're stuck down here. Please send down the bucket and the rope.
What the hell are you doing at the bottom of a well?
Don't ask these stupid questions, we're stuck, just send down the bucket. Come on.
Oh. See guys. Wishes do come true.
Alright Mahodies, follow me!
Don't worry. Here. We're leaving. I brought you some more food.
Is that too tight?
Yes, it is.
If you let yourself out, I'll break your legs.
What are you doing? How many times I gotta tell you? You sit too close to the television set you're gonna screw up your enima, alright?
Jake! Leave him alone!
I had nothing on him.
Hare Krishna...Hare Krishna...Hare Krishna...
Come on. Let me out.
H-H-Hi, s-sir. M-M-M-M-My name's Lawrence. Ha Ha...sometimes people call me "Chunk".
Help, help! Let me out of here!
You know, Ma, you never know what we're gonna find down here. Could be ghosts.
Okay, let's get down there.
Whoa, look at this. Look how deep it is down there. Oh.
Look at that.
Come on, Jake. You first.
I ain't gonna go first, Ma. Wha, you kiddin' me?
. Go!
Can't argue with that, Ma. Alright.
Troy, throw some money down, okay?
I can see it. Hey Troy! Come on!
Hey, you guys. I'm the smartest, so I'm gonna to go first, okay?
Get out of there. I'm the oldest, so I'll call the shots. Andi goes first. I go second. Stef and Mikey go third. Data, you go fourth.
Chance at what, Mikey? Getting killed? Look, if we keep going someone's really gonna get hurt, maybe dead. Besides, we gotta get to the police.
Maybe Chunk already got to the police.
Maybe Chunk is dead.
Don't say that. Never say that. Goonies never say "die".
I'm not a Goonie. I wanna go home.
I forgot. But still...don't you realize? The next time we see sky it'll be over another town. The next time you take a test, it'll be in some other school. Our parents, they want the bestest stuff for us. But right now they gotta do what's right for them, 'cause it's their time. Their time, up there. Down here it's our time. It's our time down here. That's all over the second we ride up "Troy's bucket".
Andi! You Goonie!!
Spread it around. Try to make your frosting look a little bit rugged.
Chocolate? Ha ha. Chocolate.
Want a candy bar?
What you do now...
Look, I got a Baby Ruth. Sir?
Huh, huh. Wha? Ahh? Ruth..Ruth..Ruth..Baby Ruth.
I'm gonna throw it to you, okay?
Ahh!
Aaaaaagh!
Aaagh!
I'm sorry, sir. I tried to give it to you. Oh, I'm sorry.
AAAh!
I'm really sorry.
Aaagh!
What're you doing?
Uh!
What're you doing?
Uh! Ah!
What?
Hey? Ha.
Geez, Mister, you're even hungrier than I am.
Booby traps!
Booby traps!
Booby traps. It's only booby traps. Why you bein' such a sissy?
Friggin' kids.
Niente. Kids must have cleaned him out, Mama.
Sure, right before they ate him.
Stupid.
Follow them size fives.
Sloth.
Chunk.
Sloth... Chunk!
Ah! Ha ha ha!
Man, you smell like Phys-Ed.
Mouth, hold this.
Translate this.
Copper bones, westward foams...
Westward foams.
...triple stones.
Triple stones. This must be "Copper Bones".
Huh? Sorry.
Wow! Look at that.
What?
Triple stones!
Triple stones?! We found it, Mikey. Maybe we can find a way out!
Triple stones? What are you talking about?
We got you now, One-eyed Willy. We're comin' up right behind ya.
Why couldn't I have a little sister? Just a little sister, instead of that!
Westward foams...
Maybe...
No, that's too big. Try the middle one.
You guys are crazy.
How 'bout the middle?
It fits, Mikey! It fits!
We got it!
We got it. Wait. Wait. Which way do we turn?
We got you now, One-eyed Willy.
Which way do we turn?
West?
West; counter-clockwise.
Counter-clockwise.
Try it, Mikey. Try it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Aaagh!
What the hell is that?!
Look out.
Oh my God! It's gonna fall on us or something!
It's another one of Willy's tricks. Get out of the way!
What?
Aaaaaagh!
Data!!!
Data!
Data!
Data!
Data!
Data, please!
He's gone.
Oh, no...
He's really truly gone.
Don't be dead.
Pinchers of Peril! You guys, I've been saved by my Pinchers of Peril!
He's alive! He's alive!
Guys, I'm in another room!
Hello, Sheriff? I'm at the old Lighthouse Lounge and I want to, and I want to report, ah...a murder.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just hold on here. Is that you again, Lawrence?
Sheriff, look. This time I'm telling you the truth. I'm locked inside the Fratelli's basement with this guy...
Rocky Road, heh heh.
Yeah, like the time you told me about the fifty Iranian terrorists who took over all the Sizzler Steak houses in the city?
Sloth, get back here. Sloth, what are you doing?
Just like that last prank about all those little creatures that multiply when you throw water on 'em?
Sloth! Sloth! We're not going in the fireplace.
Lawrence?
No Sloth, it's just your echo.
Echo! Whoa.
No Sloth, I'll show you. Don't go down there. It's all dark down there, Sloth. It's your echo, Sloth. Echo.
I gotta go to the bathroom. Pee break. Who's gotta go?
Me.
Me.
Me.
Me.
Me.
Okay then, this is the little boy's room, and that tunnel's the little girl's room. Let's go.
Brand, where are you going?
This is the men's room.
Where are you guys going?
Men's room, Mikey.
Yeah, we're going to the men's room.
Yeah, Mikey's been through here all right.
Uh oh.
Andi, this not the time of the place for this.
Believe me, I know what I'm doing. Brand! Brand!
Go see what she's ragging about, will ya?
Brand? Hurry, I'm in here. With my eyes closed!
Hey loverboy, it's this way.
Thanks.
All right, you kissed now tell.
There's something weird.
What? What is it?
Does Brand wear braces? Why are you laughing? Stef, it was beautiful.
Next time you kiss him, do it with your eyes open. It's a whole different experience.
Ah, be careful around here, there's a whole I think. I think Brand was standing in it.
Hey Ma, after we dump the kids how do we get outta here. I ain't been leaving no trail of breadcrumbs, you know.
The boys are right around here somewhere, I'm telling you. I can smell their bubblegum.
Ma, look! I'll give you three guesses who left this. You all right?
What are you, crazy? They're here!
They're here? They're here! They're here! They're here!
Quiet! Right down there.
You guys! This way, this way! Follow me! Don't fall behind. Come on!
Watch your step, Ma.
Watch your own!
What is this?!
Keep going, you guys!
This looks like a drawbridge or something.
Jerk Alert!!
Somebody's coming!
Hurry up!
They're over here!
Data, hurry up!
Don't' be a fool, Data. Come on!
I've got a great idea, guys. Slick shoes!
Slick shoes, are you crazy?!
Okay, good job. I can see their flashlights.
Hiya fella's, remember me?
We just wanna get outta here.
Stop or I'm gonna shoot!
Holy Mackenzie!
What are you doing? You're gonna start a cave in, here!
Cave in! What the hell do you think that was?
Brand, hurry up with that lantern, it's pitch black.
Do you have some matches or something?
No.
Ah, light it on the lamp.
Good idea.
Just cross now.
Wait a minute!
Just cross!
Don't push me!
Hurry up!
Sweetheart, are you okay?
No.
These are all solid. Look at this.
Wow. What is that?
It's disgusting.
Yo.
Wow!
Narly.
That's atrocious, you guys.
Look at all these bones, how did they put all these
Help him, help him! Hurry up!
What are you doing? You're letting them get away.
Mama!
What's that matter with you two?
To move on play the tune as each note said. If you make too many mistakes, ye will surly be
What? What?
Be what?
Muerto.
Muerto?
What's what? Come on!
Dead.
Oh, God!
Dead.
You mean we gotta play the bones to get outta here.
Exactly.
Were they out there? Hurry up.
You guys, look! There's notes on this.
Andi. Andi, you took piano lessons.
I was four years old.
Do you want to live to be 17? Hit it!
Okay, I have to find middle C. This is nothing like my mother's style.
Do something. Hurry!
Okay, the first chord, I think, is
My God, it's working. It's working, you guys. Way to go, Andi. Way to go!
It's all coming back to me now! Okay, um, A, C sharp, D.
Remember those lessons and play it right, please!!
They're coming guys. They're down there. They're coming up. What should I do?
All right!
They're coming! Guys, they look really pissed off!
What were you thinking?
I hit the wrong note! I'm not Liberachi you know!
Listen, listen, you're doing fine.
Andi, I believe in you. Goonies always make mistakes. Just don't make any more. Now come on.
Ah, where was I? A, A flat
Play it!
All right! Good!
They're coming you guys!
I can't tell if it's an A sharp or a B flat.
You hit the wrong note, we'll all be flat.
Let's go guys. Hurry up!
Go, go, go! Grab ahold of my hand!
Toss me the gun. Give me the gun!
Brand wait!
What? What are you doing?
The map!
Let's get outta here!
Geranimo!
Oh shit!
Are you okay, Mouth? Andi, are you okay?
What?
Oh my god.
Oh, wow!
Oh my god! Oh god!
Follow me.
Idiots!
Come on you guys.
Do you really think there's a treasure here?
Andi, this whole ship's a treasure.
Oh! Mikey look.
Ah, it's nothing to worry about Andi, it's only a skeleton. Ewww.
There's gotta be gold.
Data's okay. Data's okay. Ahhh!
Data are you okay?
Data's okay. But Data's tired of falling and Data's tired of skeletons.
Why didn't you use the stairs.
Use the stairs! Some idiot up there tells me to use the stairs when Data's falling. Data says nobody cares anymore. Stairs.
Data's okay.
And they tell me I have stupid inventions. And I'm spending months and months studying on them and inventing them. God! What fun I have.
Don't touch that.
Why? He's dead, he doesn't care.
Put that down.
Well have some respect. Put it down.
How many ships did you say there were?
Billions.
Billions. Billions?
Okay, be careful you guys. These stairs are slippery. Okay guys, don't slip. Don't slip.
Oohh.
Mouth translate.
Ah, translate nothing! It's just a sketch of the old cannonball chamber. Where's the gold?!
Where's the gold, Mikey!
Uh-oh.
What?
I think I set off another trap.
I'm sorry. Are you okay?
All right, break through.
What's up there?
It's okay, Brand. Just give me a second.
Okay.
Geez. And all these guys must've died. Willy. One-Eyed Willy. Hello. I'm Mike Walsh, you've been expecting me. Haven't you? Well I made it. I beat you. I got here in once piece. So far. So, that's why they call you One-Eyed Willy. One-Eyed Willy. We had a lot in common, huh Willy? You know something Willy? You were the first Goonie. Yo. Hi guys. How's it going? This is Willy. One-Eyed Willy. Say hi, Willy. Those are my friends. The Goonies. How long have you guys been standing there?
Long enough, Mikey. Long enough.
What are you staring at? Load up, anything you can put in your pockets. Except that!
Why?
That's Willy's. Save that for Willy. Anything else.
Bye bye marbles.
Oh my god. Oh my god!
Hey come on, those creeps are still after us.
What are we gonna do about them?
I don't know. I don't care.
I've got an idea.
What is it?
I saw this on the Hardy Boys once. We lead a trail of jewels into one cave, and then hide out in another, and when the Fratelli's go into that cave, then we can make a run for it.
Now that sounds like a great idea!
Yo!
Outside!
Okay! This is war!
Data, no!
I said outside!
No! We will not be taken alive, Mikey.
We? What do you mean we?
Data! Data!
It's not funny, Data. She's got a gun!
Outside! Let's go!
Data!
Oh, I love that.
That's great.
Move it!
I know what I'm doing.
Data is unhappy.
Ahhh!
Pinchers of Peril. Ha ha!
Let me help you brother.
My gun!
That's it! No more Mr. Nice Guy!
You come with me.
Empty your pockets! Come on!
Lets go! All of it! You're so quiet all of a sudden. You're the one they call Mouth, aren't you?
Oh my God! Is that all?
Mmmhmm.
Oh my god!
You gross old witch!
You wanna play pirates, huh? We'll play pirates.
No!
We'll play pirates. Keep going smarty. Say good bye to your little friends.
I can't do it with my hands tied.
Now walk the plank.
Brand!
Andi! Look out! Get out of the way! Andi!
Two down! Who's next?
Hey! You're pulling my hair.
Hey you get that girl away from me.
Go join your friends you weasels.
Hey you guys!!

Sloth! How'd he get out?
Save 'em!
Ay Sloth!

Oh, shit.
Sloth, remember the time we went to the Bronx Zoo?
Don't start that.
He and mama wanted to leave you there. Who spoke up for you?
We never been to the Bronx Zoo.
Remember the time we were gonna get your teeth fixed and we spent the money on Francis's toupee?
I don't wear a hair piece.

Rock a bye baby, on the tree top. When the wind blows your cradle will bob. When the bow breaks the cradle will fall
Ahhh.breakfall. Mama F: Oh, I only dropped you once.
Ahh!
Well maybe twice.
Ahhh!
Put me down! Sloth, put me down!
It's gonna be okay. We're gonna be all right.
Get the rope.
I don't wanna.
Calm down. Calm down!
Sloth, this is the guys. Guys, this is Sloth.
Hi. Hello.
Brand, we can't go. We can't leave all that gold. That's our future.
No, Mikey, we stay here we got no future. We'll come back for it later.
Oh, all that rich stuff.
Come on!
Mama! Just let us down easy, Ma.
Not the sword! Don't do that!
You all right?
Yeah. You?
Yeah.
Will you get up! Let's go find the gold!
That's it! A light!

What the hell is that?
Another one of those
Booby traps!!
Let's get outta here!
What booby trap?! What booby trap?!
Booby trap. Didn't you see the movie?
Look you guys, daylight. There's been a cave in here before. Maybe we can get through. I can't see through the side though. You got a light?
I got that last candle. Mikey get it.
Okay, hurry up.
Is there a way out or what?
Is there an opening or not?
Hey, this is a funny candle. It's sparkling.

Okay, okay.
Can I take piano lessons?
Hold it right there.
That's great, Dad!
Just watch this.
Come here Daddy.
He's just like his father.
That's okay Daddy. You can't hug a photograph.
You are my best invention.
I just wanted to say thank you, for offering to save my life.
What, what?
Well, I wanted to say thank you.
Wow, thank you. A real moment. You know your voice is kinda nice when your mouth isn't screwing it up.
Thanks. And you know your looks are kind of pretty when your face doesn't screw it up.
Hey, Mikey. Hey, you know, you're a great little kidahperson. And you know, you keep kissing girls the way you do, and the parts of you that don't work so goodthey're gonna catch up to the ones that do.
What
Let her mother worry.
Ahwho needs it.
It's the Fratelli's.
Here we are, Officer.
We need your help.
All right, you're all under arrest. Let's go!
Hey! Don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!
You don't know what you're doing. Get them outta here!
These are the bad guys! Those are the bad guys!
Ma!
No. Put him down. It will be all right.
Wow!
Do you know who I am? Do you want to lose your job?
Sloth. You're gonna live with me now.
Ah?
Yeah. I'm gonna take care of ya. Cause I love ya.
Oh, I love you, Chunk.
I love you, Sloth.
All right, Walsh. Today's the day. So lets get this over with.
Irving.
I'm sorry, Irene.
Come on, Walsh. We don't have all day. There's 50 more houses to tear down after yours.
It's okay, Brand.
Sheriff, I want you to witness this.
Sorry Dad. We had our hands on the future, but we blew it to save our own lives. Sorry.
That's all right. You and Brand are home safe with your mom and me. That makes us the richest people in Astoria.
Walsh. You're looking at the richest people in Astoria. Now sign it.
I'm sure gonna miss being a Goonie.
What's she saying, Mouth? What's she saying?
Nono penno write
No sign! No sign!
How dare you
No sign!
What's in the bag?
Wow!
Dad! Dad, it's my marble bag. The Fratelli's forgot to check it. See, I emptied the marbles out and I put the jewels in. We don't have to leave the Goondocks.
Oh, they'll be no more signing today or ever again.
Are those jewels real? How did you find them?
What happened out there? Were your lives in danger?
The octopus was very scary.
Octopus?
It was very dangerous.
The scariest thing was walking the plank.
Walking the plank?
And then we found the pirate ship

or a cabdriver or a plumber...
but his main job was selling drugs.
before he could even sell 'em.
Then he'd have to beat her up.
Growing up with parents like that...
I heard a lot, and I saw a lot.
lnstead of keeping me out of trouble...
they turned me on to it.
That fucker's got some love up there.
There were some tears of joy.

Why does he act like this?
What y'all talkin' about at home?
Hey, Keisha, hurry up!
Bring the motherfuckin' plate!
Excuse my language.
Excuse my language.
Why do you think that's so funny?
Because it is.
I could see it now.
You goin' to mess around and bring back...
one of your devils to my house.
Why you gonna throw that on me?
Whoa. Hey, boy.
I brought you in.
I'll take you out.
What's up, Caine?
Took you long enough, my brother.
Anyway.
Hey, Kaydee.
So what's up, young buck?
I'm all right.
How's work?
White man always on your back.
But what else is new?
Have a seat.
What's up, man?
What y'all talking about?
Not much. Just chattin'.
We talkin' about this Kansas trip.
Kansas?
So what about Kansas?
So what are you gonna do, Kaydee?
What's that, sir?
I don't know about no Kansas.
I hear you there.
before he found the Nation.
they say regarding black people.
then I'm all for it.
You got to think about your life.
Bein' a black man in America...
isn't easy.
The hunt is on.
And you're the prey.
All I'm sayin' is...
All I'm sayin' is...
survive.
All right?
and my dad never said anything.
Baby in the black shorts?
I fucked her.
I did, fool.
I hope you wore a hat...
'cause I know a couple of brothers...
that done eased up in that.
Don't play me like that.
You know I'm packin' the plastic.
Whoever that is.
Who is Willy Lump-Lump?
A little inside thing. lt ain't nothin'.
Growin' up in the hood...
especially with a car like mine.
A  .  and Daytons?
I knew we was in for it.
Spread your legs.
This motherfuckin' hood is hot!
I thought you boys liked barbecue.
Go get somebody's cat out of a tree.
Shut up!
Get down there!
Sit down and shut up.
That's enough. Come on.
Read me my rights!
Just because I'm a black man.
That's why.
I'd beat your motherfuckin' ass!
That's why...
Shut the fuck up!
If I was white...
Get the fuck in the car.
Fuck, man! This thing hurts!
What the fuck you doing with us?
Quit fuckin' moving!
Fuck this, man!
Stop fucking moving!
Shut the fuck up!
I told you to quit fucking moving!
Hey, get me the wire cutters, esse.
Fuck you, homes.
I ain't doin' this shit.
Are you gonna go with me or what?
What's your fucking problem?
That's cool, homes.
But don't forget, all right, homes?
Check it out, homes.
What's up?
What is, homes?
See? Over there.
Let's move on 'em, esse.
Don't sweat, OK?
That night, the cops let us have it.
where the esse stay.
I guess they was thinking...
we'd get our ass kicked even more.
The esses was cool, though.
They took us to the hospital.
They took us to the hospital.
You know you can read this yourself.
I know, but I like it when you read it.
Did they do somethin' bad?
No, I don't think they did.
I think it was a big mistake.
Just a big mistake.
You know, with Caine...
That's not true, not true at all. Some...
Mom, is Caine gonna die?
Caine's not gonna die.
Caine's gonna be just fine.
So don't worry about it.
He'll be fine.
You look so mean.
Why don't you smile for a change?
I ain't got shit to smile about.
You're alive, ain't you?
Yeah, and who says that's good?
Well, guess what.
I got a job.
For real?
Yup. Sure did.
My aunt hooked it up for me.
Makin' decent money, too.
It's about    a year.
What the fuck you gonna be doin'?
I'm gonna be doin' office stuff, thank you very much.
You know, filing, typing...
That's cool.
Gettin' the coffee...
Stuff like...like that.
The job is in Atlanta.
Did you hear me?
I said the job is in Atlanta.
Take it.
You might as well get the hell away from here.
To be honest...
You know what I was hopin'?
Come with you?
I don't know.
I don't see it as such a bad idea.
Why are you so worried about me?
Why shouldn't I be?
Think about leaving, Caine.
I got to thinkin'...
about all the things I done on the streets...
and all the things...
I didn't want him to grow up...
lt was all so crazy.
Empecé a ver las cosas de una manera diferente.
lt was the end of the summer.
Ronnie had a going-away party.
and Stacy and Sharif...
were gettin' ready to leave for Kansas.
Why are you drinkin' up all the beer?
Go ahead on with that.
Who, like Caine?
'Cause whenever that motherfucker come...
"Caine..." that's the key word, nigga.
You ain't Caine.
Stop drinkin' up all the beer.
You're all on his nut sack.
Why don't you wash your feet?
Kiss my ass, motherfucker.
You got one, motherfucker.
Like I was sayin'...
when we got to go to them for jobs?
Kevin, I was talkin' to the young lady.
We're not equal until...
Who is it?
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sellin' encyclopedias, motherfucker.
Oh, y'all brought jokes.
Please...
It's the Wax in the house
And the 'hood rat's in the house
'Hood rats?
Don't start that 'hood rat shit.
You can break something on me...
Yo, baby.
Goddamn, what you talkin' about?
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about.
Go take that shit outside.
And take it now, please.
Want to go outside?
Hey, little man, what you doin'?
Just playin' games.
I'm thirsty.
Can I have some beer?
Beer? No.
You may have some juice.
This is for the homeys who ain't here.
My motherfuckin' cousin Harold.
Hey, Reef, why don't you go ahead...
and get a little hit of this?
It's all right, Kevin.
You're a little punk.
Yo, what's up?
'fore your mama try to kill us all.
What you doin' out here?
Just kickin' it.
Let me have a drink.
No, man.
What's wrong with you, Kevin?
Don't be giving this kid no liquor.
You ain't his daddy.
You're not either, Kevin.
You know better.
Come on. Let's make it. Get in the house.
It's about to rain out here.
Pussy-whip.
Take your juice and go to your room.
Go on, boy.
What up, babe?
I'm fine.
Come here.
Chill.
Chauncy, chill out, nigga.
I'm just jokin'.
You know you're my nigga, Caine.
Caine, me and you, baby.
Cock-blockin' motherfucker...
Why haven't I heard from you?
I been busy.
About leavin' with you?
I thought about it.
Why are you trippin'?
You ain't doin' jack shit here.
Ain't nothin' gonna change in Atlanta.
I'm still gonna be black.
Just another nigga from the ghetto.
'Cause it's true.
You act like Atlanta ain't in America.
They don't give a fuck.
You know what?
He asked me if you were gonna die.
If you were gonna die, Caine.
Are you gonna come with us or not?
Yeah, I'm gonna go.
That's not cool, all right?
Let me guess, man.
You was up in there knockin' it out.
Get out of my business, Stace.
Why you sweatin' me?
Chauncy, please, would you stop it?
Come here. I want to talk to you.
About what?
Let me get this dance.
Come on, Ronnie.
Can you just sit down?
Just a fuckin' kiss, goddamn it.
Will you stop it?
Dog, you strapped?
You know it.
Give me your gun.
What for?
Give me the motherfuckin' gun.
What you gonna do, Caine?
What you need a gun for?
Man, come on...
Caine, stop it.
It's not that serious!
Will you stop it?
You're going to kill him!
Get him off of him!
Stop, man.
Anthony, get in your room!
Get in your room!
Fuck that, man! Fuck off!
Fuck that shit, man!
Fuck him!
It's me.
llena, what's up?
I'm pregnant.
What?
I'm pregnant.
What the fuck you tellin' me for?
What?
So you're just gonna dog me?
lt ain't mine.
You're the only one I was with.
Stop lyin', all right?
That don't mean nothin', Caine.
That mean it's not mine.
Peace.
I'm telling you, this is a good-ass fight.
Yeah, nigga?
I bet you Caine won't be laughin'...
You can bet that shit, nigga.
Fuck Caine, nigga!
Motherfuckin' Caine.
Don't talk to me about no Caine...
Man, fuck you.
Look like you the other night.
I don't give a fuck what you tell me about it.
I don't give a fuck what you tell me about it.
How you doin'?
I'm fine. And you?
Livin'.
The baby?
He's fine.
Let me talk to Caine.
I love you.
It's been a long time, Caine.
How you doin', man?
I didn't want to see you caged in...
like some fuckin' animal.
Nah, man.
When I was growin' up...
you was like my dad, man.
Your letters...
in the beginning...
it got me through, young bro.
Away from my girl, away from my baby...
away from you.
Go with Ronnie, Caine.
That ain't even...I'm...
She's a good girl, man, you know?
I just want her to be happy.
Take care of my son.
I can't do shit for him in here.
All right?
Give me some.
Give me some.
Hey, nigga, give up the car right now.
Look at your ass, scared straight.
Nigger, I was just trippin' with you.
I ain't got time for this shit no more.
Where youse comin' from, C?
Went to the pen to see Pernell, man.
For real?
That nigga get mad at you, or what?
Aw, he all right.
Cool. That boy out there.
Which one of y'all is Caine?
Who is this fool, man?
Who want to know?
A friend, homey.
Homey, I don't think you know me.
Check this out.
I'm llena's cousin, partner.
and I don't either.
We supposed to fight over a bitch?
Homey, scrap that fool.
Rush him, nigga!
Hell, you stomped again.
Stop!
Caine, chill, man.
Get your ass in the house!
Motherfucker.
Proverbs   :  ... "Cast out the scorner...
"and the contention shall go out.
"Yea, strife and reproach shall cease."
So, what you trying to say, Grandpa?
Son, you got to go.
What y'alI want me to do?
I want you out of here tonight.
We're sorry, Caine.
Y'all not too sorry.
Y'all kickin' me out.
I've done all I can do for you.
I wasn't gonna tell y'all till later...
but in a couple of weeks...
I'm moving to Atlanta with Ronnie.
Can I just stay until then?
Grandma, I'm not...
Lord knows I do.
Grandma...
Fine.
The same day I was leavin'...
over that liquor store robbery.
He didn't care, though.
O-Dog was gonna kill him...
I ain't goin' nowhere...
and you'll be a silly motherfucker...
if you leave with this broad, man.
Straight up. I ain't bullshittin'.
Just you and Ant movin'...
Can you just take the box to the car?
What's this for?
So you can take it to the car.
I ain't the one leavin'.
Sell-out motherfucker.
What seems to be your problem?
I was just thinkin' about...
sayin' good-bye to my grandparents.
You haven't talked to them yet?
But can you take some of these bags...
to the car, please?
You ain't goin' where?
Hey, cuz, come on.
Don't worry about shit.
I'm gonna handle this nigga for ya.
I got to handle my business.
Stupid ass, quit lookin' around.
Just get in the car.
What's up, homeys?
Let's go! Let's do this!
Let's go! Let's do this!
I ain't gettin' paid for this shit.
Nobody's not gettin' paid, Kevin.
You already got a gang of shit in here.
Fuck that.
Fuck. Y'all niggas ready?
somethin' real proper like.
I just bought you a new Big Wheel.
You still gonna hit me, right?
Just gonna crash into me, huh?
Motherfucker.
You lazy.
L-a-z-y, lazy.
You're lazy. You know that, right?
What's up now, partner?
Get down, Ronnie! Stay down!
Damn, Sharif.
What the fuck happened, man?
Get off me! I gotta get Anthony!
Get up!
Oh, my God, Caine!
Get Anthony out of here!
Go get some fuckin' help, man!
Get some fuckin' help!
Not my niggas.
Come on, homey.
You're gonna be all right, man.
Get some fuckin' help!
Get the fuck outta here!
Oh, shit. It's OK.
I can't lose you now.
Fight. Fight.
Come on, baby.
blastin'.
Like I said...
or when.
I had done too much to turn back...
and I had done too much to go on.
Yeah, I do.
And now it's too late.
And now it's too late.

Yeah.
Is everything in place?
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
I know, but I want to take your shift.
You like watching him, don't you? You like watching him.
Don't be ridiculous.
We're going to kill him, do you understand that?
Morpheus believes he is the one.
Do you?
It doesn't matter what I believe.
You don't, do you?
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
Are you sure this line is clean?
Yeah, of course I'm sure.
I better go.
Freeze, Police. Hands on your head. Do it. Do it now.
Lieutenant...
Oh shit.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders.
Hey, I'm just doing my job. You give me juris- my diction crap, you can cram it up your ass.
Your orders were for your protection.
I think we can handle one little girl.... I sent two units. They're bringing her down now.
No Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
Morpheus, the line was traced, I don't know how.
I know, they cut the hard line. There's no time, you're going to have to get to another exit.
Are there any agents?
Yes.
God-dammit.
You have to focus, Trinity. There's a phone at Wells and Lake. You can make it.
All right.
Go.
That's impossible.
Get up Trinity. Just get up. Get up.
She got out.
It doesn't matter.
The informant is real.
Yes.
We have the name of their next target.
The name is Neo.
We'll need a search running.
It has already begun.
What? What the hell?... Follow the white rabbit?... Who is it?
It's Choi.
Yeah. Yeah. You're two hours late.
I know, it's her fault.
Got the money?
Two grand.
Hold on.
Hallelujah. You're my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ.
You get caught using that...
Yeah, I know. This never happened. You don't exist.
Right.
Something wrong, man? You look a little whiter than usual.
My computer, it... You ever have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
Mm, all the time. It's called Mescaline. It's the only way to fly. Hey, it just sounds to me like you need to unplug, man. You know, get some R and R. What do you think, DuJour? Shall we take him with us?
Definitely.
I can't, I have work tomorrow.
Come on, It'll be fun. I promise.
Yeah, sure, I'll go.
Hello Neo.
How do you know that name?
I know a lot about you.
Who are you?
My name is Trinity.
Trinity. The Trinity? That cracked the IRS d-base?
That was a long time ago.
Jesus.
What?
I just thought, um...you were a guy.
Most guys do.
It you on my computer. How did you do that?
Right now all I can tell you is that you're in danger. I brought you here to warn you.
Of what?
They're watching you, Neo.
Who is?
Please just listen. I know why you're here, Neo. I know what you've been doing. I know why you hardly sleep, why you live alone, and why night after night you sit at your computer. You're looking for him. I know, because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer. It's the question that drives us mad. It's the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did.
What is the Matrix.
The answer is out there, Neo. It's looking for you. And it will find you, if you want it to.
Oh shit. Oh shit shit.
You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson. You believe that you are special, that somehow the rules do not apply to you. Obviously you are mistaken. This company is one of the top software companies in the world because every single employee understands that they are part of a whole. Thus if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem. The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson. Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forward or you choose to find yourself another job. Do I make myself clear?
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart, perfectly clear.
Thomas Anderson?
Yeah, that's me.
Ok, great. Have a nice day.
Hello.
Hello Neo. Do you know who this is?
Morpheus.
Yes. I've been looking for you, Neo. I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately you and I have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo, and I don't know what they're going to do.
Who's coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
What, right now.
Yes, now. Do it slowly. The elevator.
Oh shit.
Yes.
What the hell do they want from me?
I don't know, but if you don't want to find out I suggest you get out of there.
How?
I can guide you but you must do exactly as I say.
Ok.
The cubicle across from you is empty.
What if they...
Go, now...Stay here for just a moment. When I tell you, go to the end of the row, to the office at the end of the hall. Stay as low as you can.... Go, now.... Good. Now, outside there is a scaffold.
How do you know all this?
We don't have time, Neo. To your left there's a window. Go to it.... Open it. You can use the scaffold to get to the roof.
No way. No way. This is crazy.
There are two ways out of this building. One is that scaffold, the other is in their custody. You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.
This is insane. Why is this happening to me? What did I do? I'm nobody.... Shit.... I can't do this.
Shit.
As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson. It seems that you've been living two lives. In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company, you have a social security number, you pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias Neo and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not. I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson. You're here because we need your help. We know that you've been contacted by a certain individual, a man who calls himself Morpheus. Now whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant. He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive. My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you but I believe that you wish to do the right thing. We're willing to wipe the slate clean, give you a fresh start and all that we're asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.
Yeah. Wow, that sound like a really good deal. But I think I got a better one. How about I give you the finger... and you give me my phone call.
Um, Mr. Anderson. You disappoint me.
You can't scare me with this Gestapo crap. I know my rights. I want my phone call.
Tell me, Mr. Anderson, what good is a phone call if you're unable to speak.... You're going to help us, Mr. Anderson whether you want to or not.
This line is tapped, so I must be brief. They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know, you'd probably be dead.
What are you talking about. What...what is happening to me?
You are the one, Neo. You see you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent my entire life looking for you. Now do you still want to meet?
Yes.
Then go to the Adam Street Bridge.
Get in.
What the hell is this?
It's necessary, Neo. For our protection.
From what.
From you. Take off your shirt.
What?
Stop the car. Listen to me, Copper-top. We don't have time for twenty questions. Right now there's only one rule, our way or the highway.
Fine.
Please, Neo. You have to trust me
Why?
Because you have been down there, Neo. You know that road. You know exactly where it ends. And I know that's not where you want to be.... Apoc, lights. Lie back, lift up your shirt.
What is that thing?
We think you're bugged.... Try and relax.... Come on. Come on.
It's on the move.
Shit.
You're going to loose it.
No I'm not. Clear.
Jesus Christ, that thing's real?
This is it. Let me give you one piece of advice. Be honest. He knows more than you can imagine.
At last. Welcome, Neo. As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
It's an honor to meet you.
No, the honor is mine. Please, come. Sit down. I imagine that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole? Hm?
You could say that.
I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. Ironically, this is not far from the truth. Do you believe in fate, Neo?
No.
Why not?
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
I know exactly what you mean. Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain. But you feel it. You've felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?
The Matrix?
Do you want to know what IT is? The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us, even now in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
What truth?
That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage, born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind.... Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. This is your last chance. After this there is no turning back. You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.... Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.... Follow me.... Apoc, are we online?
Almost.
Time is always against us. Please, take a seat there.
You did all this?
Uh-huh.
The pill you took is part of a trace program. It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
What does that mean?
It means buckle your seat belt, Dorothy, because Kansas is going bye-bye.
Did you...
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real. What if you were unable to wake from that dream. How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?
This can't be...
Be what? Be real?
It's going into replication.
Apoc?
Still nothing.
It's cold. It's cold.
Tank, we're going to need a signal soon.
We've got fibrillation.
Apoc, location.
Targeting almost there.
It's going into arrest.
Lock, I've got him.
Now, Tank. Now.
Welcome to the real world. We've done it, Trinity. We've found him.
I hope you're right.
I don't have to hope. I know it.
Am I dead?
Far from it.
He still needs a lot of work.
What are you doing.
Your muscles have atrophied, we're rebuilding them.
Why do my eyes hurt?
You've never used them before. Rest, Neo. The answers are coming.
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
More important than what is when.
When?
You believe it's the year 1999 when in fact it's closer to 2199. I can't tell you exactly what year it is because we honestly don't know. There's nothing I can say that will explain it for you, Neo. Come with me. See for yourself. This is my ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. It's a hovercraft. This is the main deck. This is the core where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix. Most of my crew you already know. This is Apoc, Switch, and Cypher.
Hi.
The one's you don't know, Tank and his big brother, Dozer. The little one behind you is Mouse. You wanted to know what the Matrix is Neo? Trinity.... Try to relax. This will feel a weird.
This is the construct. It's our loading program. We can load anything from clothing, to equipment, weapons, training simulations, anything we need.
Right now we're inside a computer program?
Is it really so hard to believe? Your clothes are different. The plugs in your arms and head are gone. Your hair is changed. Your appearance now is what we call residual self image. It is the mental projection of your digital self.
This...this isn't real?
What is real. How do you define real? If you’re talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. This is the world that you know. The world as it was at the end of the twentieth century. It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix. You've been living in a dream world, Neo. This is the world as it exists today.... Welcome to the Desert of the Real. We have only bits and pieces of information but what we know for certain is that at some point in the early twenty-first century all of mankind was united in celebration. We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to AI.
AI? You mean artificial intelligence?
A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. We don't know who struck first, us or them. But we know that it was us that scorched the sky. At the time they were dependent on solar power and it was believed that they would be unable to survive without an energy source as abundant as the sun. Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate it seems is not without a sense of irony. The human body generates more bio-electricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 BTU's of body heat. Combined with a form of fusion the machines have found all the energy they would ever need. There are fields, endless fields, where human beings are no longer born, we are grown. For the longest time I wouldn't believe it, and then I saw the fields with my own eyes. Watch them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living. And standing there, facing the pure horrifying precision, I came to realize the obviousness of the truth. What is the Matrix? Control. The Matrix is a computer generated dream world built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this.
No. I don't believe it. It's not possible.
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo. I just said it would be the truth.
Stop. Let me out. Let me out. I want out.
Easy, Neo. Easy.
Take this thing off me. Take this thing...
Listen to me...
Don't touch me. Stay away from me. I don't want it. I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
He's gonna pop.
Breathe, Neo. Just breathe.
I can't go back, can I?
No. But if you could, would you really want to? I feel I owe you an apology. We have a rule. We never free a mind once it's reached a certain age. It's dangerous, the mind has trouble letting go. I've seen it before and I'm sorry. I did what I did because...I had to. When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside who had the ability to change whatever he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit. It was he who freed the first of us, taught us the truth. As long as the Matrix exists the human race will never be free. After he died the Oracle prophesied his return and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix and the war, bring freedom to our people. That is why there are those of us who have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix looking for him. I did what I did because I believe that search is over.... Get some rest, you're going to need it.
For what?
Your training.
Morning, did you sleep? You will tonight, I guarantee it. I'm Tank, I'll be your operator.
You don't...you don't have any...
Holes? Nope. Me and my brother, Dozer, we're both one hundred percent pure, old fashioned, home grown human, born free right here in the real world. A genuine child of Zion.
Zion?
If the war was over tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
It's a city?
The last human city. The only place we have left.
Where is it?
Deep underground, near the earth's core where it's still warm. Live long enough you might even see it. God-damn, I...I got to tell you, I'm fairly excited to see what you're capable of, if Morpheus is right and all...I'm not supposed to talk about this, but if you are...a very exciting time. We got a lot to do. We got to get to it.... Now, we're supposed to start with these operation programs first, that's a major boring shit. Let's do something more fun. How about combat training.
Jujitsu? I'm going to learn Jujitsu?... Holy shit.
Hey Mikey, I think he likes it. How about some more?
Hell yes. Hell yeah.
How is he?
Ten hours straight. He's a machine.
I know Kung Fu.
Show me.
This is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix. It has the same basic rules, rules like gravity. What you must learn is that these rules are no different that the rules of a computer system. Some of them can be bent. Others can be broken. Understand? Then hit me if you can.... Good. Adaptation, improvisation. But your weakness is not your technique.
Morpheus is fighting Neo.
How did I beat you?
Your too fast.
Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles in this place? You think that's air you're breathing now?... Again.
Jesus Christ, he's fast. Take a look at his neural-kinetics, they're way above normal.
What are you waiting for? You're faster than this. Don't think you are, know you are.... Come on. Stop trying to hit me and hit me.
I don't believe it.
I know what you're trying to do.
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but I can only show you the door, you're the one that has to walk through it. Tank, load the jump program.... You have to let it all go, Neo, fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind.
Whoa. Okie dokie. Free my mind.
So what if he makes it?
No one's ever made the first jump.
I know, I know. But what if he does?
He won't.
Come on.
Come on.
All right, no problem. Free my mind. Free my mind. All right.
Wha...what does that mean?
It doesn't mean anything.
Everybody falls the first time. Right, Trin?
I thought it wasn't real.
Your mind makes it real.
If you're killed in the Matrix, you die here?
Your body cannot live without the mind.
I don't remember you bringing me dinner. There is something about him, isn't there?
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
I just keep wondering, if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to see the Oracle?
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around. What do you see. Business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it. Were you listening to me Neo, or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?
I was...
Look again. Freeze it.
This...this isn't the Matrix?
No. It's another training program designed to teach you one thing. If you are not one of us, you are one of them.
What are they?
Sentient programs. They can move in and out of any software still hard wired to their system. That means that anyone we haven't unplugged is potentially an agent. Inside the Matrix, they are everyone and they are no one. We are survived by hiding from them, by running from them. But they are the gatekeepers. They are guarding all the doors. They are holding all the keys, which means that sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them.
Someone?
I won't lie to you, Neo. Every single man or woman who has stood their ground, everyone who has fought an agent has died. But where they have failed, you will succeed.
Why?
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air. Yet their strength and their speed are still based in a world that is built on rules. Because of that, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
What are you trying to tell me, that I can dodge bullets?
No Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
We've got trouble.
Did Zion send word?
No, another ship. Shit. Squiddies. We've been in crick.
Squiddy?
A sentinel. A killing machine designed for one thing.
Search and destroy.
Set her down right over there.... How're we doing, Tank?
Power off line. EMP armed and ready.
EMP?
Electromagnetic pulse. Disables any electrical system in the blast radius. It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
Where are we?
There old service and waste systems.
Sewers?
They used to be cities that spanned hundreds of miles. Now these sewers are all that's left of them.
Quiet.
Whoa, Neo. You scared the bejeezus out of me.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Is that...
The Matrix? Yeah.
Do you always look at it encoded?
Well you have to. The image translators work for the construct program. But there's way too much information to decode the Matrix. You get used to it. I...I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, red-head. Hey, you a... want a drink?
Sure
You know, I know what you're thinking, because right now I'm thinking the same thing. Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here. Why, oh why didn't I take the blue pill?... Good shit, huh. Dozer makes it. It's good for two things, degreasing engines and killing brain cells. So, can I ask you something? Did he tell you why he did it, why you're here? Jesus. What a mind job. So you're here to save the world. What do you say to something like that? A little piece of advice. You see an agent, you do what we do. Run. Run your ass off.
Thanks for the drink.
Sweet dreams.
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan.
You know, I know this steak doesn't exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is bliss.
Then we have a deal?
I don't want to remember nothing. Nothing. You understand? And I want to be rich. You know, someone important, like an actor.
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
Okay. I get my body back into a power plant, you insert me into the Matrix, I'll get you what you want.
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
No, I told you, I don't know them. I can get you the man who does.
Morpheus.
Here you go, buddy. Breakfast of champions.
If you close your eyes it almost feels like you're eating runny eggs.
Yeah, or a bowl of snot
Do you know what it really reminds me of? Tasty Wheat. Did you ever eat Tasty Wheat?
No, but technically, neither did you.
That's exactly my point. Exactly. Because you have to wonder now. How did the machines know what Tasty Wheat tasted like. huh?. Maybe they got it wrong. Maybe what I think Tasty Wheat tasted like actually tasted like oatmeal or tuna fish. That makes you wonder about a lot of things. You take chicken for example, maybe they couldn't figure out what to make chicken taste like, which is why chicken tastes like everything. Maybe couldn't figure out...
Shut up, Mouse.
It's a single cell protein combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins, and minerals. Everything the body needs.
It doesn't have everything the body needs. So I understand that you've run through the agent training program. You know, I wrote that program.
Here it comes.
So what did you think of her?
Of who?
The woman in the red dress? I designed her. She, um...well she doesn't talk very much, but...but if you'd like to meet her, I can arrange a much more personalized meeting.
Digital pimp, hard at work.
Pay no attention to these hypocrites, Neo. To deny our own impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human.
Dozer, when you're done, bring the ship up to broadcast depth. Wer'e going in. Taking Neo to see her.
See who?
The Oracle.... Everyone please observe the fasten seat belt and no smoking signs have been turned on. Sit back and enjoy your ride.
We're in.... We'll be back in an hour.
Unbelievable, isn't it.
God.
What?
I used to eat there. Really good noodles. I have these memories from my life. None of them happened. What does that mean?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
And the Oracle can?
That's different.
Did you go to her?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
She told me...
What?
We're here. Neo, come with me.
So is this the same Oracle that made the prophecy?
Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.
The beginning...?
Of the resistance.
And she knows what, everything?
She would say she knows enough.
And she's never wrong.
Try not to think of it in terms of right and wrong. She is a guide. She can help you to find the path.
She helped you?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
That I would find the one.... I told you I can only show you the door. You have to walk through it.
Hello, Neo. You're right on time.... Make yourself at home, Morpheus. Neo, come with me.... These are the other potentials, you can wait here.
Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible. Instead only try to realize the truth.
What truth?
There is no spoon.
There is no spoon?
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.
The Oracle will see you now.
I know you're Neo. Be right with you.
You're the Oracle?
Bingo. Not quite what you were expecting, right? Almost done. Smell good, don't they?
Yeah.
I'd ask you to sit down, but your not going to anyway. And don't worry about the vase.
What vase?
That vase.
I'm sorry.
I said don't worry about it. I'll get one of my students to fix it.
How did you know?
What's really going to bake your noodle later on is, would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything. You're cuter than I expected. No wonder she likes you.
Who?
Not too bright, though. You know why Morpheus brought you to see me?
I think so.
So, what do you think? You think you're the one?
I don't know.
You know what that means? It's Latin. Means `Know thyself'. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Being the one is just like being in love. No one can tell you your in love, you just know it. Through and through. Balls to bones. Well, I better have a look at you. Open your mouth, say Ahhh.
Ahhh.
Okay. Now I'm supposed to say, `Umm, that's interesting, but...' then you say...
But what?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
I'm not the one.
Sorry kiddo. You got the gift, but it looks like you're waiting for something.
What?
Your next life maybe, who knows? That's the way these things go. What's funny?
Morpheus. He...he almost had me convinced.
I know. Poor Morpheus. Without him we're lost.
What do you mean, without him?
Are you sure you want to hear this? Morpheus believes in you, Neo. And no one, not you, not even me can convince him otherwise. He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
What?
You're going to have to make a choice. In the one hand you'll have Morpheus' life and in the other hand you'll have your own. One of you is going to die. Which one will be up to you. I'm sorry, kiddo, I really am. You have a good soul, and I hate giving good people bad news. Oh, don't worry about it. As soon as you step outside that door, you'll start feeling better. You'll remember you don't believe in any of this fate crap. You're in control of your own life, remember? Here, take a cookie. I promise, by the time you're done eating it, you'll feel right as rain.
What was said was for you and for you alone.
They're on their way.... What is that?
Whoa, deja vu.
What did you just say?
Nothing, I just had a little deja vu.
What did you see?
What happened?
A black cat went past us, and then another that looked just like it.
How much like it, was it the same cat?
Might have been, I'm not sure.
Switch, Apoc.
What is it?
Deja vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix. It happens when they change something.
Oh my God.
Let's go.
They cut the hard line, it's a trap. Get out.
Oh no. Oh no.
That's what they changed. We're trapped. There's no way out.
Be calm. Give me your phone.
They'll be able to track it.
We have no choice.
Operator.
Tank. Find a structural drawing of this building. Find it fast.
Got it.
I need the main wet wall.
Eighth floor.
Eighth floor.
Switch, straight ahead.
Neo. I hope the Oracle gave you some good news.
Another left, that's it.
Good.
Where are they?
They're in the walls. They're in the walls.
It's an agent.
Morpheus.
You must get Neo out. He's all that matters.
No. No, Morpheus. Don't.
Trinity, go.
Go.
We can't leave him.
We have to.... Cypher, come on.
The great Morpheus. We meet at last.
And you are.
Smith. Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.
Take him.
No.
Operator.
Yeah, I need an exit fast.
Cypher?
Yeah, there was an accident. God-damn car accident. All of a sudden, boom. Somebody up there still likes me.
Gotcha.
Get me out of here fast.
Intersection of Franklin and Erie, an old TV repair shop.
Right.
Tank, it's me.
Is Morpheus alive?
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?
They're moving him. I don't know where to yet.
He's alive. We need an exit.
You're not far from Cypher.
Cypher?
I know. He's at Franklin and Erie.
Got it.
Got him.
Where are they.
Making the call.
Good.
You first, Neo.
Shoot.
No.
I don't know, it just went dead.
Hello, Trinity.
Cypher? Where's Tank?
You know, for a long time, I thought I was in love with you. I used to dream about you. You're a beautiful woman, Trinity. Too bad things had to turn out this way.
You killed them.
What?
Oh God.
I'm tired, Trinity. I tired of this war. I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, being cold, eating the same God-damn goop everyday. But most of all, I'm tired of that jack-off and all of his bullshit. Surprise ass-hole. I bet you never saw this coming, did you? God, I wish I could be there, when they break you. I wish I could walk in just when it happens. So right then, you'd know it was me.
You gave him Morpheus.
He lied to us, Trinity. He tricked us. If you'da told us the truth, we woulda told you to shove that red pill right up your ass.
That's not true, Cypher, he set us free.
Free? You call this free? All I do is what he tells me to do. If I had to choose between that and the Matrix, I choose the Matrix.
The Matrix isn't real.
I disagree, Trinity. I think the Matrix can be more real than this world. All I do is pull the plug here. But there, you have to watch Apoc die.
Trinity.
No.
Welcome to the real world, huh baby.
But you're out, Cypher. You can't go back.
Oh no. That's what you think. They're going to reinsert my body. I go back to sleep, and when I wake up, I won't remember a God-damn thing. By the way, if you have anything terribly important to say to switch, I suggest you say it now.
No, please don't.
Not like this. Not like this.
Too late.
God-damn you, Cypher.
Don't hate me, Trinity. I'm just the messenger, and right now I'm going to prove it to you. If Morpheus was right, then there's no way I can pull this plug. I mean if Neo's the one, then there'd have to be some kind of a miracle to stop me. Right? I mean how can he be the one if he's dead? You never did answer me before. If you bought into Morpheus' bullshit -- come on -- all I want is a little yes or no. Look into his eyes, those big pretty eyes. Tell me. Yes or no.
Yes.
No.
I don't believe it.
Believe it or not, you piece of shit. You're still gonna burn.
You first.
You're hurt.
I'll be all right.
Dozer?
Have you ever stood and stared at it, marveled at it's beauty, it's genius? Billions of people just living out their lives, oblivious. Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world. Where none suffered. Where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed that we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering. The perfect world would dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this, the peak of your civilization. I say your civilization because as soon as we started thinking for you it really became our civilization which is of course what this is all about. Evolution, Morpheus, evolution, like the dinosaur. Look out that window. You had your time. The future is our world, Morpheus. The future is our time.
There could be a problem.
What are they doing to him.
Breaking into his mind. It's like hacking into a computer, all it takes is time.
How much time?
Depends on the mind. Eventually it will crack and his alpha patterns will change from this to this. When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Well what do they want.
The leader of every ship is given codes to Zion's mainframe computer. If an agent got the codes and got into Zion's mainframe, they could destroy us. We can't let that happen.
Trinity.
Zion's more important than me or you or even Morpheus.
Well there has to be something that we can do.
There is. We pull the plug.
You're going to kill him? Kill Morpheus?
We don't have any other choice.
Never send a human to do a machine's job.
If indeed the insider has failed, they'll sever the connection as soon as possible, unless...
They're dead, in either case...
We have no choice but to continue as planned. Deploy the sentinels immediately.
Morpheus, you're more than a leader to us. You're our father. We'll miss you always.
Stop. I don't believe this is happening.
Neo, this has to be done.
Does it? I don't know, I... this can't be just coincidence. It can't be.
What are you talking about?
The Oracle. She told me this would happen. She told me that I would have to make a choice.
What choice?... What are you doing?
I'm going in.
No you're not.
I have to.
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself so that he could get you out. There's no way that you're going back in.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed I am something I'm not.
What?
I'm not the one, Trinity. The Oracle hit me with that too.
No. You have to be.
Sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy.
No, Neo. That's not true. It can't be true.
Why?
Neo, this is loco. They've got Morpheus in a military controlled building. Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. Three of them. I want Morpheus back too, but what you're talking about is suicide.
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not. I can't explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed. I understand that now. But that's why I have to go.
Why?
Because I believe in something.
What?
I believe I can bring him back.... What are you doing?
I going with you.
No you're not.
No? Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you. I believe if you were really serious about saving him you are going to need my help. And since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like, I believe you can go to hell. Because you aren't going anywhere else. Tank, load us up.
I'd like to share a revelation during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague, and we are the cure.
Okay. What do you need, besides a miracle?
Guns. Lots of guns.
Neo, no one has ever done anything like this.
That's why it's going to work.
Why isn't this serum working?
Perhaps we're asking the wrong questions.
Leave me with him. Now.
Hold on, Morpheus. They're coming for you. They're coming.
Can you hear me, Morpheus? I'm going to be honest with you. I hate this place, this zoo, this prison, this reality, whatever you want to call it. I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink. And every time I do I feel I have somehow been infected by it. It's repulsive, isn't it? I must get out of here. I must get free and in this mind is the key, my key. Once Zion is destroyed there is no need for me to be here, don't you understand? I need the codes. I have to get inside Zion, and you have to tell me how. You're going to tell me or you're going to die.
Please remove any metallic items you're carrying, keys, loose change. Holy shit.
Backup. Send backup.
Freeze.
What were you doing?
He doesn't know.
Know what?
I think they're trying to save you.
There is no spoon.
Find them and destroy them.
I repeat, we are under attack.
Trinity. Help.
Only human.
Dodge this.... How did you do that?
Do what?
You moved like they do. I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Wasn't fast enough. Can you fly that thing.
Not yet.
Operator.
Tank, I need a pilot program for a V-212 helicopter. Hurry.... Let's go.
No.
Morpheus, get up. Get up, get up.... He's not going to make it.... Gotcha.
Trinity.
I knew it. He's the one.
Do you believe it now, Trinity?
Morpheus. The Oracle, she told me I'm...
She told you exactly what you needed to hear, that's all. Neo, sooner or later you're going to realize, just as I did, there's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Operator.
Tank.
God-damn. It's good to hear your voice, sir.
Need an exit.
Got one ready. Subway station, State and Balboa.
Damn it.
The trace was completed.
We have their position.
The sentinels are standing by.
Order the strike.
They're not out yet.
You first, Morpheus.
Neo, I want to tell you something, but I'm afraid of what it could mean if I do. Everything the Oracle told me has come true. Everything but this.
Neo.
What just happened?
An agent. You have to send me back.
I can't.
Mr. Anderson.
Run, Neo. Run! What is he doing?
He's beginning to believe.
You're empty.
So are you.
I'm going to enjoy watching you die, Mr. Anderson.
Jesus, he's killing him.
Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson? That is the sound of inevitability. That is the sound of your death. Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
My name is Neo.
What happened?
I don't know. I lost him. Oh shit.
Sentinels. How long?
Five, maybe six minutes. Tank, charge the EMP.
You can't use that until he's out.
I know, Trinity, don't worry. He's going to make it.
Shit, that's my phone. That's my best phone.
That's unknown.
Mr. Wizard, get me the hell out of here.
Got a patch on an old exit, Wabash and Lake.
Oh shit.... Help. Need a little help.
Door.... Door on your left. No, you're other left.... Back door.
Oh no.
Here they come.... He's going to make it.
Fire escape at the end of the alley. Room 303.
They're inside.
Hurry, Neo
Can't be.
Check him.
He's gone.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
Neo, I'm not afraid anymore. The Oracle told me that I would fall in love, and that man, the man who I loved would be the one. And so you see, you can't be dead. You can't be, because I love you. You hear me? I love you.... Now get up.
No.
How?
He is The One.
Neo.
Come in. Sit down.
Care if I talk? I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.
Uh, just please don't move.
Oh, sorry. I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've ever had one of these-
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Sure.
One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
That's the hotel.
What?
Where I live.
Nice place?
Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
No, just warming you up, that's all.
Oh. It's not fancy or anything.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of the sudden-
Is this the test now?
Yes. You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down-
What one?
What?
What desert?
It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely hypothetical.
But how come I'd be there?
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling toward you-
Tortoise, what's that?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
Same thing.
I've never seen a turtle. But I understand what you mean.
You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write them down for you?
The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without your help, but you're not helping.
What do you mean I'm not helping?
I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? They're just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response. Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good things that come in to your mind
your mother.
My mother?
Yeah.
Let me tell you about my mother. [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a newspaper] Overhead
A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure. New climate... Overhead
A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure. New climate, recreation facilities...
They don't advertise for killers in the newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer. Overhead
Use your new friend as a
Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold fish.
Hey, idi-wa. Chinese
He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Got the wrong guy, pal.
Chinese
He say you blade runner.
Tell him I'm eating.

Bryant, huh?
climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going to make it easier for him.
...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
Hiya Deck.
Bryant.
You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal. C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the streets.
Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants. In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men niggers.
They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks ago so we know they're around.
Embarrassing.
No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're going to air them out.
I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're not cop, you're little people.
No choice, huh?
No choice pal. ---
I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've ever had one of these-
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Yeah, sure.
1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Yeah, that's the hotel.
What?
Where I live.
Nice place?
Yeah, sure I guess--
There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago. Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself one.
So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling toward you.
Tortoise, what's that?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
Same thing.
I've never seen a turtle.
I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for? That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
. What's this?
Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast, she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built in a fail-safe device.
Which is what?
Four year life span.
Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want you to go put the machine on it.
And if the machine doesn't work?
I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion, so he didn't want me back anyway.
Do you like our owl?
It's artificial?
Of course it is.
Must be expensive.
Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard.
It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
May I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
No.
But in your position that is a risk?
Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary dilation of the iris?
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Where's the subject?
I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative before I provide you with a positive.
What's that going to prove?
Indulge me.
On you?
Try her.
It's too bright in here.
Do you mind if I smoke?
It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can. It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly collection plus the killing jar.
I take him to the doctor.
You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a wasp crawling on your arm.
I'd kill it.
You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude photo of a girl.
Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?
Just answer the questions, please. You show it to your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
bush outside your window
I wouldn't let him.
orange body, green legs
Why not?
I should be enough for him.
One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The entree consists of boiled dog.
Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? Thank you.
She's a replicant, isn't she?
I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot them?
I don't get it Tyrell.
How many questions?
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
She doesn't know?!
She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we can control them better.
Memories. You're talking about memories. [Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching Leon's video.]
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Sure.
One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Yeah, That's the hotel.
What?
Where I live.
Nice place?
Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
No-- [Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an origami statue of a man with an erection.]
I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
Time enough. Did you get your precious photos?
Someone was there.
Man? Policeman?

Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores, burning with the fires of Orc.
. You not come here. Illegal. Hey. Hey. Cold! Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Yes, questions.
Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I design your eyes.
Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes. Questions.
I don't know answers.
Who does?
Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Tyrell corporation?
He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Ah, smart.
Cold.
Not an easy man to see--
Very cold.
I guess?
Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Sebastian who?
J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
Describe in single words, only the good things that come in to your mind
your mother.
My mother?
Yeah.
I'll tell you about my mother. **** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard, ninety-seven.
Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
I wanted to see you, so I waited. Let me help.
What do I need help for?
I don't know why he told you what he did.
Talk to him.
He wouldn't see me.
Do you want a drink? No? No?
You think I'm a replicant, don't you? Look, it's me with my mother.
Yeah. Remember when you were six? You and your brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that? Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a bush outside your
orange body, green legs. Watched her build a web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg hatched--
The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And they ate her.
Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. Okay, bad joke. I made a bad joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go home. Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was. Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories. [Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers herself in trash pile.]
Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Hey! You forgot your bag.
I'm lost.
Don't worry, I won't hurt you. What's your name?
Pris.
Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Hi.
Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
We sure did.
I'm hungry J. F.
I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
I was hoping you'd say that.
Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody.
.
Watch out for the water.
Must get lonely here J. F.
Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you know what that is?
No.
Yoo-hoo, home again.
Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Good evening, fellas. Toy
Oooh!
They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
I'm sort of an orphan.
Oh, what about your friends?
I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I am tomorrow.
Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't they?
Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out, track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop. Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop. Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57 to 19. Track 45 left. Stop. Enhance 15 to 23. Give me a hard copy right there.
Fish?
I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71. Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Snake?
Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
How many?
Very few.
How few? Look my friend.
Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Blow me.
You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
All the time, pal.
Every see this girl, huh?
Never seen her, buzz off.
Your licenses in order pal?
Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
Hello?
I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector. Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a drink?
I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Go someplace else?
Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once corrupted man.
Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Oh, yeah?
I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on Moral Abuses.
Committee of Moral Abuses?
Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
I don't know nothing about it.
Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
How do you mean, exploited?
Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh, repulsive to your person, huh?
Ha. Are you for real?
Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
For what?
For, uh, for holes.
Holes?
You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
No, I wouldn't.
Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress. Is this a real snake?
Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place like this if I could afford a real snake? So if somebody does try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Me.
You're a dedicated man. Hari
Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Street
Cross now... Don't walk...
Move! Get out of the way!
The report would be routine retirement of a replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for Rachael.
Deckard. B-263-54. Street
Move on...
Yeah what do you want?
Tsing tao. This enough?
Yeah.
Bryant.
Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you left on the sidewalk.
I'm going home.
You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff, let's go.
Three. There's three to go.
There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell. Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
Leon.
How old am I?
I don't know.
My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Four years.
More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Oh, I agree.
Wake up! Time to die.
Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
I'm not in the business. I am the business.
What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt me?
No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the longevity, those things. You saw them?
They're classified.
But you're a policeman.
I didn't look at them.
You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take that test yourself? Deckard?
I dreamt music.
I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
You play beautifully.
Say kiss me.
I can't rely on.
Say kiss me.
Kiss me.
I want you.
I want you.
Again.
I want you. Put your hands on me.
Whatcha doing?
Sorry, just peaking.
Oh.
How do I look?
You look better.
Just better?
Well, you look beautiful.
Thanks. How old are you?
Twenty-five.
What's you problem?
Methuselah's syndrome.
What's that?
My glands. They grow old too fast.
Is that why you're still on earth?
Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like it here.
I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J. F. Sebastian.
Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by yourself, do ya?
Yes. How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna make some.
Well?
Leon--
What's going on.
Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
No we won't.
No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Yes.
What generation are you?
Nexus six.
Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Like what?
Like anything.
We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Very good Pris, now show him why.
We've got a lot in common.
What do you mean?
Similar problems.
Accelerated decrepitude.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We can't allow that. Is he good?
Who?
Your opponent.
Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a genius. He designed you.
Maybe he could help.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort of hard man to get to.
Yes, very.
Will you help us?
I can't.
We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
We're so happy you found us.
I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who would have helped us.
66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous. Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. What's on your mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Bishop to King 7.
Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
What can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes.
Would you like to be modified?
Stay here. I had in mind something a little more radical.
What-- What seems to be the problem?
Death.
Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my jurisdiction, you--
I want more life, fucker.
The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised once it's been established.
Why not?
Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
What about EMS recombination.
We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the subject was dead before he left the table.
Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
But not to last.
The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
I've done questionable things.
Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
I'm working. What are you doing?
Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm filed and monitored Okay, checked and cleared. Have a better one.
Hello?
Hi, is J. F. there?
Who is it?
This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F. Toy
Oooh! [Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris... again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard. Show me what you're made of.
Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Arrggh.
This is for Pris.
Arrgghh.
Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot straight.
Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four. Pris...
Arrghhh.
I'm coming. Four, five. How to stay alive. I can see you! Not yet. Not...
Yes...
You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to hell, go to heaven.
Yeah, that's the spirit.
That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like. Ha ha ha. Where are you going? [Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy follows, after tossing a bird.]
Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave.
I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain. Time to die.
I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going? How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Finished.
Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?
Do you love me?
I love you.
Do you trust me?
I trust you.
Rachael?
Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Gaff had been there, and let her live. Four years, he figured. He was wrong. Tyrell had told me Rachael
no termination date. I didn't know how long we had together, who does?
[<pre> Our pasta this evening...
is squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...
with goat cheese profiteroles, and I also have an arugula Caesar salad.
For entrees this evening, I have swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade, rare roasted partridge breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale.
...and grilled free-range rabbit with herbed french fries.
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth.
God, I hate this place.
It's a chick's restaurant.
Why aren't we at Dorsia?
Because Bateman won't give the maitre d'head.
Is that Reed Robinson over there?
Are you freebasing or what?
That's not Robinson.
Well, who is it then?
It's Paul Allen.
That's not Paul Allen.
Paul Allen's on the other side of the room over there.
Who's he with?
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there?
Yes, McDufus, I am.
He's handling the Fisher account.
Lucky bastard.
Lucky Jew bastard.
Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything?
I've seen that bastard sitting in his office...
talking on the phone to the C.E.O.s, spinnin'a fuckin'menorah.
Not a menorah.
You spin a dreidel.
Oh, my God, Bateman.
Do you want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes?
Some latkes?
No, just...
cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.
Oh, I forgot.
Bateman's dating someone from the A.C.L.U.
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.
Speaking of reasonable-Only $570.
That's not bad.
A little something for the purse.
Give her the 50.
Stoli on the rocks.
These aren't good anymore.
It's a cash bar.
That'll be $25.
You're a fucking ugly bitch.
I wanna stab you to death...
and play around with your blood.
What can I get for you two?
I live in the American Gardens building...
on West 81st Street on the 11th floor.
My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.
I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine.
ln the morning, if my face is a little pufffy, I'll put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches.
I can do a thousand now.
After I remove the icepack, I use a deeppore cleanser lotion.
In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser.
Then a honey-almond bodyscrub.
And on the face, an exfoliating gelscrub.
Then I apply an herb mint facialmasque, which lleave on forten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.
I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.
Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman.
Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me.
Only an entity-something illusory.
And though I can hide my cold gaze...
and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours...
and may be you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.
Good morning.
Good morning, Hamilton.
Nice tan.
Late.
Aerobics class.
Sorry.
Any messages?
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.
He didn't say what he was cancelling or why.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club.
Anyone else?
Spencer wants to meet for drinks at Fluties, Pier 17.
When?
After 6:00.
And what should I say?
Negative.
Cancel it.
Just say "no" Just say "no"?
Okay, Jean.
I need reservations for three at Camols at 12:30, and if not there try Crayons.
Allright?
Yes, sir.
Oh, wait.
And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.
Something romantic?
No.
Silly.
Forget it.
I'll make them.
No, I'll do it.
No, no.
Be a doll and just get me a mineral water, okay?
You look nice today.
Don't wear that outfit again.
What?
I didn't hear you.
I said, do not wear that outfit again.
Wear a dress, a skirt or something.
You don't like this, I take it.
Come on.
You're prettier than that.
Thanks, Patrick.
I'm not here.
And high heels.
I like high heels.
Feathered friends for 600.
During courtship, the male frigate bird...
inflates to enormous size the red pouch found here.
And I want hundreds of thousands of roses.
And lots of chocolate truffles, Godiva, and oysters in the halfshell.
I'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but Evelyn, my supposed fiance, keeps buzzing in my ear.
Annie Leibovitz.
We'll get Annie Leibovitz.
And we'll have to get someone to videotape.
Patrick, we should do it.
Do what?
Get married.
Have a wedding.
No.
I can't take the time off work.
Your father practically owns the company.
You can do anything you like, silly.
I don't want to talk about it.
I hate that job anyway.
I don't see why you just don't quit.
Because I want to fit in.
Williams party.
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace, since I'm positive we won't have a decent table.
But we do, and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.
Patrick, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash.
They're both artists.
The menu's in braille.
I see you've met everyone.
You look awful.
Okay.
Allright.
I'm fairly certain that...
Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair.
Timothy is the only interesting person I know.
I'm almost completely indifferent as to whether Evelyn knows...
I'm having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson, her closest friend.
Courtney is almost perfect looking.
She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs.
Tonight, I believe, it's Xanax.
Mmm.
Oh.
More disturbing than her drug use, though, is the fact that she's engaged...
to Luis Carruthers, the biggest doofus in the business.
Tell me, Stash.
Do you think Soho is becoming too...
commercial?
Yes.
I read that.
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?
Hey, that affects us.
Well, what about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey?
Doesn't that affect us too?
Do you know anything about Sri Lanka?
How, like, the Sikhs are killing tons of Israelis over there?
Come on, Bryce.
There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about.
Like what?
Well, we have to end apartheid, for one, slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger.
We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless...
and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights, while also promoting equal rights for women.
We have to encourage a return...
to traditional moral values.
Most importantly, we have to promote general social concern...
and less materialism in young people.
Patrick, how thought provoking.
Hello.
Hello.
Bleaching?
Are you trying to say "bleaching"?
Oh, my God.
Two things.
One: You can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.
Two: I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe.
These are very expensive sheets, and I really need them cleaned.
Lady, if you don't shut your fucking mouth, I will kill you.
Now, listen.
I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison.
I need those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.
Listen, I can't understand you!
This is crazy!
You're a fool.
I can't cope with this stupid "bitchee"!
Understand?
Christ.
Patrick?
Hi, Patrick.
I thought that was you.
Hello.
This is- Isn't it ridiculous, coming all the way up here?
They really are the best.
Then why can't they get these stains out?
I mean, can you talk to these people or something?
I'm not getting anywhere.
Oh, what are those?
Well, it's- Cranberry juice.
Cranapple.
Really?
Listen, if you could talk to them, I would really appreciate it.
I'm really late.
I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in 15 minutes.
Hubert's?
That moved uptown, right?
Oh, boy.
Listen, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.
Maybe we could do lunch one day next week.
I'm downtown quite often.
What about a Saturday?
I'm at work all the time.
Next Saturday?
Can't, I'm afraid.
Sure.
At a matinee of LesMis.
Listen, I really gotta go.
Oh, Christ.
I'll call you.
Okay.
Do.
Listen, you're dating Lewis, he's in Arizona.
You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans.
What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Stop it.
I'm-On a lot of lithium?
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin, you're dating an asshole.
Mm-hmm.
Pumpkin, you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick, stop calling me pumpkin, okay?
I have to go.
Courtney?
Hmm?
Dinner.
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Wear something fabulous.
Oh,yeah!
Dorsia.
Um, yes, I know it's a little late, but is it possible to reserve a table for two at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps?
...a facialat Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing.
And then, to the Pottery Barn, where I got this little...
silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
God, Patrick.
Shut up.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium or have a Diet Coke.
Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
I just want a child.
Just two...
perfect...
children.
Are we here?
Yeah.
This is Dorsia?
Yes, dear.
Courtney, you're gonna have the peanut butter soup...
with smoked duck and mashed squash.
New York Matinee called it "a playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it.
And then the red snapper with violets and pine nuts.
I think that'll follow nicely.
Mmm.
Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney.
Dorsia.
How impressive.
How on Earth did you get a reservation there?
Lucky, I guess.
That's a wonderful suit.
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.
Mmm, Valentino Couture?
Uh-huh.
Hmm.
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.
Hello, Halberstram.
Nice tie.
How the hell are you?
Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead, Marcus Halberstram.
It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&amp;P, and in fact does the same exact thing I do.
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses.
Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have a slightly better haircut.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
It's, uh, all right.
Really?
That's interesting.
It's not, uh, not great.
Oh, well, you know.
So, how's Cecilia?
She's a great girl.
Oh, yeah.
I'm very lucky.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, Allen, congratulations on the Fisher account.
Thankyou, Baxter.
Listen, Paul.
Squash.
Call me.
How about Friday?
No can do.
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.
Greatsea urchin ceviche.
Dorsia on Friday night?
How'd he swing that?
I think he's lying.
Is that a gram?
New card.
What do you think?
Whoa-ho.
Very nice.
Look at that.
Picked them up from the printer's yesterday.
Good coloring.
That's bone.
And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
It's very cool, Bateman, but that's nothing.
Look at this.
That is really nice.
Eggshell with Romalian type.
What do you think?
Nice.
Jesus.
That is really super.
How'da nitwit like you get so tasteful?
I can't believe that Bryce...
prefers Van Patten's card to mine.
But wait.
You ain't seen nothin'yet.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus...
white.
Impressive.
Very nice.
Hmm.
Let's see Paul Allen's card.
Look at that subtle off-white coloring.
The tasteful thickness of it.
Oh, my God.
It even has a watermark.
Is something wrong, Patrick?
You're sweating.
Hello.
Pat Bateman.
You want some, uh, money?
Some food?
Is this what you need?
I'm-I'm hungry.
Yeah.
Cold out too, isn't it?
Why don't you get a job?
If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
I lost my job.
Why?
You drinking?
Is that why you lost it?
Insider trading?
Just joking.
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Hmm?
Speak up.
Come on.
Al.
Get a goddamn job, Al.
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.
You gotta get your act together.
I'll help you.
You are so kind, mister.
You're a kind-You're a kind man.
It's okay.
I can tell.
Please, you gotta tell me what to do.
You gotta help me.
I'm so cold, I'm hungry.
You know how bad you smell?
You reek of shit.
Do you know that?
Al.
I'm sorry.
It's just that- I don't know.
I don't have anything in common with you.
Oh.
Oh, thankyou, mister.
Thankyou.
I'm cold out here.
You know what a fucking loser you are?
What?
What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman.
So fine, so smooth.
I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood, skin, hair- but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust.
Something horrible is happening inside of me, and I don't know why.
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days.
I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.
Hey, Mc Cloy, what do you say?
Hey, Hamilton.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas.
Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?
Ofcourse.
Who else?
Mistletoe alert.
Merry Xmas, Patrick.
Merry Xmas, Harry.
Merry Christmas.
You're late, honey.
Oh, yes, you are.
I'm not late.
I've been here the entire time.
You just didn't see me.
Say hello to Snowball.
Snowball says, "Merry Christmas, Patrick." What is it?
It's a little baby piggly-wiggly, isn't it?
It's a Vietnamese potbellied pig.
They make darling pets.
Don't you?
Don't you?
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a grinch.
And what does Mr Grinch want for Christmas?
And don't say breast implants again.
Allen.
Marcus.
Merry Christmas.
How you been?
Workaholic, I suppose?
Haven't seen you in a while.
Hey, Hamilton.
We're goin'to Nell's.
Limo's out front.
We should have dinner.
Maybe you could bring- Cecilla?
Yes, Cecilla.
Oh, Cecilla would adore it.
Well, then, let's do it, Marcus.
Great party.
Thanks.
Patrick, why is he calling you Marcus?
Mistletoe alert.
Marcus Halberstram for two at 7:00.
No, l want to know, okay?
I came here for the cilantro crawfish gumbo, which is, after all, the only excuse one could have for being in this restaurant, which is, by the way, almost completely empty.
I'm very sorry, sir.
J&amp;B straight, and a Corona.
Would you like to hear-Double Absolut martini.
Yes, sir.
Would you like to hear the specials?
Not if you want to keep your spleen.
This is a real beehive of activity, Halberstram.
This place is hot.
Very hot.
Listen, the mud soup and charcoal arugula...
are outrageous here.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child ofdivorce.
Give me a break.
I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-O.
We should've gone to Dorsia.
I could've gotten us a table.
Nobody goes there anymore.
Is that Ivana Trump?
Oh, geez, Patrick.
I mean, Marcus.
What are you thinking?
Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?
So, uh, wasn't Rothchild originally handling the Fisher account?
How'd you get it?
Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram, but then I'd have to kill you.
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know I'm utterly insane?
Great tan, Marcus.
I mean, really impressive.
Where do you tan?
Salon.
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.
And, uh, Cecilla.
How is she?
Where is she tonight?
Cecilla's, uh-Well, you know Cecilla.
I think she's having dinner with, um, Evelyn Williams.
Evelyn?
Great ass.
Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman.
What a dork.
Another martini, Paul?
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Um, they're okay.
They're early work was a little too new wave for my taste.
But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism...
that really gives the songs a big boost.
He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
Hey, Halberstram?
Yes, Allen?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place?
Do you-Do you have a dog?
A little chow or something?
No, Allen.
Is that a raincoat?
Yes, it is.
In '87, Huey released this- Fore, their most accomplished album.
I think their undisputed masterpiece is "Hip To Be Square." The song's so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics.
But they should, because it's not just about...
the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends.
It's also a personal statement about the band itself.
Hey, Paul!
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fuckin'stupid bastard!
You fucking bastard!
He was completely naked and standing up on the table.
He had no clothes on what so ever, and he- Patrick?
Patrick.
Is that you?
No, Luis, it's not me.
You're mistaken.
This is my very good friend, Patrick Bateman.
Where are you going?
We're going to Nell's.
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.
Ooh.
Where did you get that overnight bag?
Jean-Paul Gaultier.
When I get to Paul Allen's place, I use the keys I took from his pocket...
before disposing of the body.
There is a moment of sheer panic...
when I realize that Paul's apartment overlooks the park...
and is obviously more expensive than mine.
I calm myself and move into the bedroom, where I find his suitcase and start to pack.
It's time for Paul to take a little trip.
Where do I send the bastard?
Dallas?
Paris?
Singapore?
London?
I'll send the asshole to London.
Hi.
This is Paul.
I've been called away to London for a few days.
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.
What is it?
Patrick.
Yes, Jean?
There's a Mr Donald Kimball here to see you.
Who?
Detective Donald Kimball.
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.
Send him in, I guess.
Now, John, you've gotta wear clothes in proportion to your physique.
There are definite do's and don'ts, good buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt.
A bold-striped shirt calls for solid-colored...
or discreetly patterned suits and ties.
Yes, always tip the stylist 15 percent.
Listen,John, I've gotta go.
T.
Boone Pickens just walked in.
Just joking.
No, don't tip the owner of the salon.
Okay, John?
Right.
Got it.
Sorry about that.
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.
Was that anything important?
Oh, that?
Just mulling over business problems, examining opportunities, exchanging rumors, spreading gossip.
Hi.
I'm Donald Kimball.
Hi.
Pat Bateman.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry to barge in on you like this.
I know how busy you guys can get.
So, what's the, uh, topic of discussion?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell...
to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen.
I see, yeah.
Paul's disappearance, yeah.
So it's nothing that official.
I just have some questions about Paul Allen and yourself.
Coffee?
No, I'm okay.
Apollinaris?
No, I'm okay.
Can you bring Mr- Kimball.
No, I'm okay.
Mr Kimball a bottle of Apollinaris.
It's no problem.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
The disappearance of Paul Allen.
Uh-huh, right.
Well, I, um, haven't- I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything.
Not on page six, at least.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Understandable.
Lime?
No, really, I'm okay.
You sure?
I can always get you a lime.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Shoot.
Hold old are you?
Twenty-seven.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard.
Then Harvard Business School.
Your address?
The American Gardens Building, West 81st Street.
Nice.
Very nice.
Thanks.
What can you tell me about Paul Allen?
I'm at a loss.
He was part of that whole Yale thing.
"Yale thing"?
Yeah, Yale thing.
What do you mean, "Yale thing"?
Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual...
who did a lot of cocaine.
That "Yale thing." What kind of man was he, besides the information you've just given?
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
You feel like that?
No, not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang out?
Yeah, you know, hang out.
Let me think.
Um, the Newport, Harry's, Fluties, Indochine, Nell's, the Cornell Club, the New York Yacht Club.
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
And where did he go to school?
Don't you know this?
I just wanted to know if you know.
Before Yale, if I remember correctly, St.
Paul's.
Listen, I just-I just wanna help.
I understand.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine that says he went to London.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
But has anyone seen him in London?
Actually, yes.
Hmm.
But I've had a hardtime getting actual verification.
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him at a restaurant there.
But I checked it out, and what happened is...
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth for Paul, so- Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, actually, it hadn't.
Toiletries were missing, a suit was gone, so was some luggage.
That's it.
I mean, no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
No, not yet.
As I said, we're not sure.
Basically, no one's seen or heard anything.
So typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.
One day, someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then- Nothing.
People just disappear.
The earth just...
opens up and swallows them.
Eerie.
Really eerie.
Listen, you'll have to excuse me.
I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in 20 minutes.
The Four Seasons?
Isn't that a little far uptown?
I mean, aren't you gonna be late?
No, there's one down here.
Oh, really?
I didn't know that.
Yeah, it's very good.
Listen, if anything else occurs to you, any information- Absolutely.
I'm 100 percent with you.
Great.
And thanks for your time, Mr Bateman.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been lookin'.
Would you like to see my apartment?
I'm not supposed to.
Do you wanna come to my apartment or not?
I'm not supposed to, but I can make an exception.
Do you take a credit card?
I'm joking.
Come on.
Get in.
I'd like a girl.
Early 20s.
Blonde, who does couples.
Couples.
And I really can't stress blonde enough.
Blonde.
I'm Paul.
My name's Paul Allen.
You got that?
You're Christie.
You're to respond only to Christie.
Is that clear?
That's a very fine chardonnay you're drinking.
I want you to clean your vagina.
No.
From behind.
Get on your knees.
You have a very nice body.
Mm-hmm?
Thank you.
Send her up.
Christie, get out and dry off.
Choose a robe-not the Bijan- and come and meet me and our guest in the living room for drinks.
You've arrived.
How lovely.
Let me take your coat.
I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.
Not quite blonde, are you?
More dirty blonde.
I'm gonna call you Sabrina.
I'm Paul Allen.
So.
Don't you wanna know what I do?
No.
No, not really.
Well, I work on Wall Street...
for Pierce &amp; Pierce.
Have you heard of it?
You have a really nice place here, Paul.
How much did you pay for it?
Well, actually, that's none of your business, Christie.
But I can assure you, it certainly wasn't cheap.
No.
No smoking.
Not in here.
Varda truffle?
I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very fine chardonnay you're not drinking.
Do you like Phil Collins?
I've been a big Genesis fan eversince the release...
of their 1980 album Duke.
Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work.
It was too artsy, too intellectual.
It was on Duke where...
Phil Collins'presence became more apparent.
I think Invisible Touch is the group's undisputed masterpiece.
It's an epic meditation on intangibility.
At the same time, it deepens and enriches...
the meaning of the preceding three albums.
Christie, take off the robe.
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing...
of Banks, Collins and Rutherford.
You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument.
Sabrina, remove your dress.
ln terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism.
Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little.
Take the lyrics to "Land of Confusion." In this song, Phil Collins...
addresses the problems of abusive political authority.
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s...
about monogamy and commitment.
The song is extremely uplifting.
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative...
as, uh, anything I've heard in rock.
Christie, get down on your knees...
so Sabrina can see your asshole.
Phil Collins'solo career...
seems to be more commercial, and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially songs like "In the Air Tonight" and "Against All Odds." Sabrina, don't just stare at it.
Eat it.
I also think that Phil Collins works best...
within the confines of the group than as a solo artist.
And I stress the word "artist." This is "Sussudio." A great, great song.
A personal favorite.
Look at the camera.
Christie, look at the camera.
Don't touch the watch.
Can we go now?
We're not through yet.
If they have a good personality and they are not great looking, then who fucking cares?
Let's just say hypothetically, okay?
What if they have a good personality?
I know.
I know.
There are no girls with good personalities.
A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body...
who will satisfy all sexual demands...
without being too slutty about things...
and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut.
The only girls with good personalities...
who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented- though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly chicks.
Absolutely.
And this is because they have to make up...
for how fucking unattractive they are.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Maitre d'at Canal Bar?
No, serial killer, Wisconsin, in the 50s.
And what did Ed say?
"When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things.
"One part of me wants to take her out and talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right." And what did the other part of him think?
What her head would look like on a stick.
Hi, guys.
I wanna get your opinion on something.
It's my business card.
I decided to get a new one too.
Oh, it's- Very nice, Luis.
Thank you.
Listen, what about dinner?
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten?
"What about fucking dinner"?
Cheer up there, Bateman.
What's the matter?
No shiatsu this morning?
Keep touching me like that, you'll draw back a stump.
Hold on there, little buddy.
Excuse me.
God.
Patrick.
Why here?
I've seen you looking at me.
I've noticed your...
hot body.
Don't be shy.
You can't imagine how long I've wanted this- ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206.
You know, the one you were wearing that red-striped paisley Armani tie.
I want you.
I want you too.
Patrick.
What is it?
Where are you going?
I've gotta return some video tapes.
Patrick!
Okay, London the- London, there's, um, a reservation-Any Paul Allen?
No.
A reservation, but-Kimball!
I've been wanting to talk with you.
Come into my office.
Jean, greatjacket.
Matsuta?
Do you remember where you were the night of Paul's disappearance, which was on the 20th of December?
God.
I guess I was probably returning video tapes.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
That's not what I've got.
What?
That's not the information I've received.
Well, I-Wait.
What information have you received?
Let me see.
Well- You were with-Well, I could be wrong.
When was the last time you were with Paul Allen?
We'd gone to a new musical...
called Oh, Africa, Brave Africa.
It was a laugh riot.
That was about it.
I think we had dinner at Orso's.
No, Peto-No, Orso's.
I hope I've been informative.
Long day, a bit scattered.
I'm a little spent now too.
But how about lunch in a week or so...
when I've sorted out all this information?
Great.
Yes, I'd like that.
And if you could try and pin down where you were...
the night of Paul Allen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Absolutely.
I'm with you on that one.
Huey Lewis and the News.
Great stuff.
I just bought it on my way here.
You heard it?
Never.
I mean, I don't really like singers.
Not a big music fan, huh?
No, I like music.
Just they're-Huey's too black sounding for me.
To each his own.
So, lunch next week?
I'll be there.
Oh!
Oh!
Will you call me before Easter?
Maybe.
What are you doing tonight?
Dinner at, uh, River Cafe.
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.
I never knew you smoked.
You never noticed.
Listen, Patrick.
Can we talk?
You look...
marvelous.
There's nothing to say.
You're gonna marry Luis.
Isn't that special?
Patrick?
Yes, Courtney?
If I don't see you before Easter, have a nice one, okay?
You too.
Patrick?
Yeah?
Nothing.
There is this theory now-Listen to me.
There is this theory now that if you can catch the AlDS virus...
by having sex with someone who's infected, then you can catch anything.
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia.
I'm not sure, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
But who knows?
They don't know that.
Prove it.
Oh, God.
What?
It's a fucking milligram of sweetener.
I wanna get high off this, not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.
It's definitely weak, but I have a feeling if we do enough of it, we'll be okay.
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to do drugs.
Fuck you!
Calm down.
Let's do it anyway.
That's right.
That is if the faggot in the next stall thinks it's okay!
Fuck you!
Hey, fuck you!
Sorry, dude.
Steroids.
Okay, let's do it.
Where did Craig go?
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.
McDermott went to sign a peace treaty...
between the United States and Russia.
He's the one behind Glasnost.
He said he was in mergers and acquisitions.
You're not confused, are you?
No, not really.
Gorbachev is not downstairs.
Karen's right.
Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.
Ask me a question.
So, what do you do?
I'm into, uh, well, murders and executions, mostly.
Do you like it?
Well, it depends.
Why?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions really don't like it.
So, where do you work out?
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
What?
You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.
No.
I really don't.
That's okay.
I don't mind.
There's something sweet about you.
Doin'the crossword?
You need any help?
-Jean?
Yes, Patrick?
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
That is, if you're not doing anything.
Um, no.
No, I don't have any plans.
Well, isn't this a coincidence?
Listen, where should we go?
Anywhere you want.
Let's not think about what I want.
How about anywhere you want?
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.
Come on.
Where do you wanna go?
Anywhere you want, just say it.
I can get us in anywhere.
What about...
Dorsia?
So, Dorsia is where Jean wants to go.
Well, I don't know.
We'll go wherever you wanna go.
Dorsia is fine.
Dorsia.
Yes?
Yeah, can you take two tonight at, oh, let's say 9:00?
We're totally booked.
Really?
That's great.
No, I said we are totally booked.
Two at 9:00?
Perfect.
See ya then.
Yeah?
You're...
dressed okay.
You didn't give a name.
They know me.
Why don't you meet me at my place at 7:00...
for drinks.
And Jean, you'll wanna change before we go out.
Patrick, it's so elegant.
What a wonderful view.
Jean, sorbet?
Thanks, Patrick.
I'd love some.
Do you want a bite?
I'm on a diet.
But thank you.
You don't need to lose any weight.
You're kidding, right?
You look great.
Very fit.
You can always be thinner, look better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner.
I don't wanna ruin your will power.
No, it's all right.
I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
So listen.
What do you really wanna do with your life?
Just briefly, summarize.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Well, I'd like to travel and maybe go back to school, but I don't really know.
I'm at a point in my life where there seems to be so many possibilities, but I'm-I don't know-I'm just so unsure.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No, not really.
Interesting.
Are you seeing anyone?
I mean, seriously?
Maybe.
I don't know.
Not really.
Jean, do you feel...
fulfilled?
I mean, in your life?
I guess I do.
For a long time I was too focused on my work.
But now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing and growing.
Growing.
I'm glad you said that.
Did you know that, uh, Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie?
Had you heard this?
Who's Ted Bundy?
Forget it.
What's that?
Duct tape.
I need it for, uh, taping something.
Patrick, have you ever wanted to...
make someone happy?
What?
No!
Put it in the carton.
Sorry.
Jean?
What?
Uh, make someone happy?
Have you ever wanted to?
I'm looking for, uh, I guess you could say I just wanna have a meaningful relationship...
with someone special.
Hmm.
Patrick?
Patrick?
I know you're there.
Pick up the phone, you badboy.
What are you up to tonight?
It's me.
Don't try to hide.
I hope you're not with some little number you picked up because you're my Mr Bateman.
My boy next door.
Anyway, you never called me and you said you would, and I'll leave a message for Jean about this, too, to remind you, but we're having dinner with Melania and Taylor.
You know Me lania.
She went to Sweet Briar.
And we're meeting at the Cornell Club, so I'll call you tomorrowmorning, honey.
Oops.
Sorry.
I know you hate that.
Bye, Patrick.
Bye, Mr Big Time C.E.O.
Bye-bye.
Was that Evelyn?
Are you still seeing her?
I'm sorry.
I have no right to ask that.
Do you want me to go?
Yeah.
I don't think I can control myself.
I know.
I should go.
I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men.
I mean, do you want me to go?
I think if you stay, something bad will happen.
I think I might hurt you.
You don't wanna get hurt, do you?
No.
No, I guess not.
I don't wanna get bruised.
You're right.
I should go.
Oh.
Don't forget you have a lunch date tomorrow with Donald Kimball at Smith and Wolenski's.
Thanks.
It slipped my mind completely.
So, the night he disappeared- any new thoughts about what you did?
Not sure.
Um, I had a shower...
and some sorbet?
I think you're getting your dates mixed up.
But how?
Where do you place...
Paul that night?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with Marcus Halberstram.
And?
I questioned him.
Marcus?
Yes, and he denies it, though, at first, he couldn't be sure.
But he denied it.
Yes.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Yes.
He does?
You'resure?
I checked it out.
It's clean.
Now, where were you?
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Allen.
Who was he with?
He was...
at Atlantis...
with...
Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner...
and...
you.
Oh, right, yeah.
Of course.
We had wanted Paul Allen to come, but he had made plans.
And I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night.
Personally, I think the guy went a little nutso.
Split town for a while.
Maybe he did go to London, sightseeing, drinking, whatever.
Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.
I mean, to think...
that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous.
Isn't that right, Patrick?
Christie.
Christie.
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency after last time.
This won't be anything like last time.
I promise.
I don't think so.
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute.
The driver's here.
You'll be safe.
Nothing like last time.
Promise.
All right.
So, you're looking great.
How have you been?
Well, I actually might need surgery after last time.
Really?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Lawyers are so complicated.
Don't do that.
Here's a check.
Uh-uh.
Half now, half later.
Okay, your name is Christie.
We're meeting a friend of mine, Elizabeth.
She'll bejoining us in my new apartment shortly.
You'll like her.
She's a very nice girl.
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton?
I think I met you at Surf Bar, didn't I?
With Spicey?
Well, maybe not with Spicey, but definitely at SurfBar.
You know, SurfBar.
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now.
It's terrible.
Went to a birthday party there for Malcolm Forbes.
Oh, my God, please.
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Oh, it's not that nice.
Where did you two meet?
Oh, God.
We met at...
oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby in '85, or '86.
You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole.
Hot number.
What do you mean?
She was a hot number.
If you had a platinum card, she'd give you a blowjob.
This girl worked in a tanning salon.
What do you do?
She's my...
cousin.
Uh-huh.
She's from...
France.
Where's your phone?
I've gotta call Harley.
Where do you summer, South Hampton?
No.
Oh, God, it's his machine.
It's 3:00 in the morning.
He's a goddamn drug dealer.
These are his peak hours.
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I?
This tastes weird.
Harley, it's me.
I need your services.
Translate that howeveryou want.
I'm at-Paul Allen's.
Who?
Paul Allen's.
I want the number, idiot.
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you again later.
And if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm gonna sic my hairdresser on you.
Did you know that guy who disappeared?
Didn't he work at Pierce &amp; Pierce?
Was he a friend of yours?
No.
Do you have any coke?
Or Halcyon?
I would take a Halcyon.
Listen.
I would just like to see...
the two of you...
get it on.
What's wrong with that?
It's totally disease free.
Patrick, you're a lunatic.
Come on.
Don't you find Christie attractive?
Let's not get lewd.
I'm in no mood for a lewd conversation.
Come on.
I think it'd be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time?
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
No.
I'm not a lesbian.
Why would you think I would be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.
You're making me feel weird.
Did you know...
that Whitney Houston's debut LP...
called simply Whitney Houston...
had four number-one singles on it?
Did you know that, Christie?
You actually listen to Whitney Houston?
You own a Whitney Houston CD?
More than one?
It's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks.
But the "Greatest Love Of All" is one of the best, most powerful songs...
ever written...
about self-preservation...
and dignity.
It's universal message crosses all boundaries...
and instills one...
with the hope that it's not too late...
to better ourselves.
Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves.
It's an important message.
Crucial, really.
And it's beautifully stated on the album.
Not the face!
You bitch, not the fucking face, you piece of bitch trash!
I want a firm commitment.
I think, um, Evelyn, that, uh, we've lost touch.
Why?
What's wrong?
My need to engage in homicidal behavior...
on a massive scale cannot be corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick?
It's over, Evelyn.
It's all over.
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry I brought up the wedding.
Let's just avoid the issue, all right?
Now, are we having coffee?
I'm fucking serious.
It's fucking over, us.
This is no joke.
Uh, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
But your friends are my friends and my friends are your friends.
I really don't think it would work.
You have a little something- I know that your friends are my friends, and, uh-and I've thought about that.
You can have 'em.
You're really serious, aren't you?
Yes, lam.
What about the past?
Our past?
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
No.
I'm in touch with humanity.
Evelyn, I'm, uh, sorry.
I just, uh- You're not terribly important to me.
Oh, no!
No.
No, Patrick.
I know my behavior can be...
erratic sometimes.
What do you want me to do?
What is it that you want?
If you really wanna do something for me, then stop making this scene right now.
Oh, God, I can't believe this.
I'm leaving.
I've assessed the situation, and I'm going.
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.
But where?
I have to return some videotapes.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Stop that.
Drop the weapon!
Drop it now!
Get on the ground!
Put your- Burning the midnight oil, Mr Smith?
Hey, now don't forget to sign in.
Howard, it's Bateman.
Patrick Bateman.
You're my lawyer, so I think you should know I've killed a lot of people.
Some escort girls in an apartment uptown, uh, some homeless people, maybe five or ten, an N.Y.U.
girl I met in Central Park.
I left her at a parking lot behind some doughnut shop.
I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun.
And-And-And then some man, s-s-some old faggot with a dog.
Last week, I, uh- I killed another girl with a chain saw.
I had to.
She almost got away.
And- Someone else there.
I can't remember, maybe a model-She's dead too.
And, uh, Paul Allen.
I killed Paul Allen with an ax in the face.
His body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.
I don't wanna leave anything out here.
I guess I've killed maybe...
20 people.
Maybe 40!
I have tapes of a lot of it.
Some of the girls have seen the tapes.
I even, um, I ate some of their brains...
and I tried to cook a little.
Tonight, I, uh- I just had to kill a lot of people!
And, um, I'm not sure I'm gonna get away with it...
this time.
So, uh-I mean, I guess...
I'm a pretty, uh- I mean, I guess I'm a pretty sick guy.
So, if you get back tomorrow, I may show up at Harry's Bar.
So, you know, keep your eyes open.
Okay.
Oh!
Are you my 2:00?
No.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for...
Paul Allen's place.
Doesn't he...
live here?
No, he doesn't.
You sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
No.
Yeah.
I mean, yeah.
ln the Times.
There was no ad in the Times.
I think you should go now.
But I think- I wanna know what happened here.
Don't make any trouble, please.
I suggest you go.
Don't come back.
I won't.
Don't worry.
Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean?
I need help.
Patrick, is that you?
Jean, I'm not- Craig McDermott called.
Wants to meet you, David Van Patten and Tim Bryce at Harry's.
Oh, God.
What did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick, I can't hear you.
What am I doing?
Where are you, Patrick?
What's wrong?
I don't think I'm gonna make it,Jean, to the, uh, office this afternoon.
Why?
Just say no!
What is it, Patrick?
Are you all right?
Stop sounding so fucking sad.
Jesus!
That's a table for three.
Bateman, you're looking wild-eyed.
Rough day?
Hey, look.
Bryce is back and he's drinking mineral water.
He's a changed man, except for he still can't a reservation to save his life.
Why don't you just try 150 Wooster?
I'm not going anywhere unless we have a reservation.
Le Cirque, Flamingo East, OysterBar.
Come on, faggots.
Let's get a "res." Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.
Need a reservation for 8:30.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Right back.
10:00 would not be any good.
No.
Just fucking call them.
Give me the phone.
I'll do it.
I'll call you back.
Face it.
The Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
Shut up, Carnes.
They will not.
So, uh, Harold, did you get my message?
Jesus, yes.
That was hilarious.
That was you, wasn't it?
Yeah, naturally.
Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls.
That's fabulous.
That's rich.
What exactly do you mean?
The message you left.
By the way, Davis, how's Cynthia?
You're still seeing her, right?
W-Wait, Harold.
What do you mean?
Excuse me.
Nothing.
It's good to see you.
Is that Edward Towers?
Carnes, wait.
Uh- Davis, I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone.
Your joke was amusing.
But come on, man.
You had one fatal flaw: Bateman is such a dork.
Such a boring, spineless lightweight.
Now, if you said Bryce or Mc Dermott.
Otherwise, it was amusing.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must be going.
Wait.
Uh-Stop.
I did it, Carnes.
I killed him.
I'm Patrick Bateman.
I chopped Allen's fucking head off.
The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Excuse me.
I really must be going now.
No.
No, listen.
Don't you know who I am?
I'm not Davis.
I'm Patrick Bateman.
We talk on the phone all the time.
Don't you recognize me?
You're my lawyer.
Now, Carnes, listen.
Listen very, very carefully.
I killed Paul Allen, and I liked it.
I can't make myself any clearer.
But that's simply not possible.
And I don't find this funny anymore.
It never was supposed to be.
Why isn't it possible?
It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Because I had dinner with Paul Allen...
twice in London just ten days ago.
No, you...
didn't.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
We've seen the results of that mistrust...
in the form of lies, provisions in the states.
We need to find a way to cooperate while realizing foreign policy...
can't be run by committee.
And I believe there's now the growing sense...
that we can accomplish more by cooperating.
And in the end, this maybe the eventual blessing in disguise...
to come out of the Iran-Contra mess.
How can he lie like that?
How can he pull that shit?
What shit?
Now, where do we have reservations at?
I'm not really hungry, but I'd like to have reservations someplace.
How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
Some guys arejust born cool, I guess.
Bateman?
What are you so fucking zany about?
I'm just a happy camper.
Rockin'and a rollin'!
Oh, brother, look.
He presents himself as this harmless old codger, but inside- but inside- But inside doesn't matter.
Inside?
Believe or not, Bryce, we're actually listening to you.
Come on, Bateman.
What do you think?
Whatever.
Whose moronic idea was it to order dry beers?
I need a scotch.
There are no more barriers to cross.
All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused...
and my utter indifference toward it, I have now surpassed.
My pain is constant and sharp...
and I do not hope for a better world for anyone.
In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others.
I want no one to escape.
But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis.
My punishment continues to elude me...
and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.
No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling.
This confession has meant...
nothing.
Word.
It's still on, and we're going.
Cyrus sent an emissary this afternoon to make sure.
Cyrus don't want anybody packed or anybody flexing any muscle.
So I gave him my word that the Warriors would uphold the truce.
Everybody says that Cyrus is the one and only.
I think we'd better go have a look for ourself.
We ain't even been to the Bronx.
No sweat.
This conclave's a big item.
Every gang in the city will be there.
We're going in with nothing.
We're going in like everybody else.
Nine guys, no weapons.
You got the stuff?
I want you to hit everything in sight.
I want everybody to know the Warriors were there.
You never what you're gonna run into.
In our colours, we can't hide.
Who wants to hide?
Maybe we'll get to waste some heads along the way.
You just soldier and keep your mouth shut.
When we get there, stick close by.
Sure, I don't want to get wrecked.
One thing we might get out of Cyrus's get-together is meeting some strange wool.
I wouldn't mind laying something down on the way back.
You got a one-track brain.
What's up?
You going faggot?
What do you know about Cyrus?
Magic.
Whole lot of magic.
What do you know about Cyrus?
He's the one and only.
When you're president of the biggest gang, you don't take any shit.
Fuck him!
I tell you something.
I'll bet nobody's even gonna be there.
Can you count, suckers?
I say the future is ours...
...if you can count.
Come on, Cyrus.
We're with you!
Go ahead, bro!
Look what we have here before us.
We've got the Saracens sitting next to the Jones Street Boys.
We've got the Moon Runners, right by the Van Courtland Rangers.
Nobody is wasting nobody.
That...is a miracle.
And miracles is the way things ought to be.
Yeah!
All right.
I heard that!
You're standing right now with nine delegates from a hundred gangs.
And there's over a hundred more.
That's hard-core members - counting affiliates, and more not organised, but ready to fight.
soldiers!
There ain't but police in the whole town.
Can you dig it?
Can you dig it?
Can you dig it?
Now, here's the sum total.
One gang could run this city.
One gang!
Nothing would move without us allowing it to happen.
We could tax the crime syndicates, the police, because we got the streets, suckers.
Can you dig it?
Right on!
The problem in the past has been the man turning us against one another.
We've been unable to see the truth, because we've been fighting for ten square feet of ground - our turf, our little piece of turf.
That's crap, brothers.
The turf is ours by right because it's our turn.
All we have to do is keep up the general truce.
We take over one borough at a time.
Secure our territory, secure our turf, because it's all our turf.
The other way, against the crowd!
Keep your ass down!
Down!
Get out of the way.
Watch out, man.
Watch his head.
What's up with that?
There wasn't supposed to be guns.
Is Cleon all right?
I think he's up there.
Are you sure?
No.
Come on, move it!
There he is!
That's him!
That's the Warrior!
He shot Cyrus!
I didn't do nothing.
We saw him!
That's him.
He's the one.
He's the one!
The Warriors did it!
The Warriors did it!
Kill him!
Come on!
Move it!
Everybody down!
Shit!
You all right?
Yeah.
Everybody quiet!
Everybody make it?
Just Cleon's missing.
Fuzz must have got him.
Did you see him?
I seen him, then he wasn't there.
I was haulin'ass.
Look around.
Make sure we're OK.
This is a graveyard.
What are we gonna do now?
We're going back.
How?!
Fuckin'Coney Island must be fifty to a hundred miles from here.
It's our only choice.
Real simple.
Except every cop in the city's lookin'to bust our heads.
There's something else to think about.
The truce, is it still on?
If it ain't, we're gonna have to bop our way back.
Shit, I wish we was packed.
If this truce is off, anything could hit us between here and that train.
If you get separated, make it to the platform at Union Square.
We change trains there.
I only got one question.
Who named you leader?
I got as much right to take over as you.
It was Cleon's choice.
Swan's War Chief.
Right now, Cleon's probably got a nightstick shoved up his ass.
I bet you can't even find the subway.
Let's talk about this later.
What's wrong with now?
I want to be War Lord.
Make your move.
Hey, Ajax, lighten up.
Big boy, Swan's War Chief.
We better stick together.
Hey, you guys, the train's there.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Let's go.
Let's move.
Don't worry about it.
Stay loose.
Ah, fuck!
Rembrandt, mark this spot.
Hey, wait for me!
Riffs!
Yeah, right!
Who are the Warriors?
There must be some word.
I want them all.
I want all the Warriors.
I want them alive, if possible.
If not, wasted.
But I want them.
Send the word.
All right, for all you boppers out there in the big city, you street people with an ear for the action, I've been asked to relay a request from the Gramercy Riffs.
It's a special for the Warriors.
That's that real live bunch from Coney.
And I do mean the Warriors.
Here's a hit with them in mind.
Be looking good, Warriors, all the way back to Coney.
You hear me, babies?
Good.
Real good.
Adios.
What kind of crap is this?
What are we waiting for?
A train would help, unless you want to get japped on the platform.
There ain't no one on the street.
We're acting like faggots.
Just keep talking.
Move.
That's the Turnbull A.C.'s.
They forgot about the truce.
No shit!
Those lousy skinheaded fucks.
That's our train.
We got to make it.
Jesus Christ!
Are we gonna go for it?
Hold the fucking train!
Go, go, go!
Close the fucking door!
Shit!
All right, Warriors!
Those guys were desperate dudes.
So was we!
We can take'em.
Bunch of chicken-shits!
They didn't look too chicken to me.
Me, either.
Well, we made it.
In an hour, it's C.I.
the Big Coney.
You got it.
Give me that fist.
When we get there, we've made it.
Hey, no sweat, War Chief.
I've got Coney Island!
How many stops to Union Square?
Come on, man.
That's high math for Rembrandt.
It's all right.
Nobody can read these maps.
What's the difference?
We're home free.
We just heard from the Turnbulls.
They blew it.
Shit.
This train's had it.
This is fuckin'impossible.
What are we gonna do?
This sucks!
Why couldn't it rain now?
We should worry about who set that goddamn fire.
Come on.
Yeah.
How are you?
I was just checking in.
Yeah, it was a real mess up there.
This guy Cyrus had an accident.
They did?
Well, that's OK.
These guys, the Warriors...
Yeah.
They deserve it.
Yeah.
We will.
Take care of yourself.
We set?
We're set, all right.
Somebody should pick them up.
The Riffs sent out the word, they want'em alive.
We don't.
The sooner someone grabs them, the better.
You afraid the Warriors will talk before they get racked?
I'm worried.
I don't want the Riffs after me.
They're looking for the Warriors, remember?
We can do some looking, too.
Ought to make you feel better.
What about the money you owe?
For what?
We've had it.
I made'em.
Two there, one there.
I think they just made us.
You recognise them?
Orphans.
So far down, they ain't even on the map.
Real low class.
Numbers.
Full strength, maybe .
A lot more than eight.
Not if they're wimps.
I'm sick of this running crap.
Come on.
This way.
Know where he's headed?
Yeah, reinforcements.
We're gonna get japped here!
No matter what he says, nobody lip off.
Nobody get hot.
I'll see what I can do.
When did you turn into a diplomat?
You ain't the State Department type.
Fox, come with me.
Show me your invitation.
How do you figure?
Well, you come armying down here, invading our territory - no permits, no parley.
We're not invading.
I'm parleying now.
We were at the meeting in the Bronx.
We're going home to Coney, the train's messed up by the fire and dumps us here.
What are you talking about?
How could there be a meeting without the Orphans?
You didn't miss anything.
A lot of heads got busted.
You think the Orphans ain't with it?
That we ain't well known?
We didn't say that.
We got a heavy rep.
Mess with us, you'll find out.
You see that?
Our raids are in the paper.
That's really heavy.
The Orphans, right?
Our youth worker talks about you.
We ain't got one.
That's because you guys are so bad, they're afraid of you.
Nothing wrong with you making it through our territory, as long as you're coming in peace.
Cut it, Mercy.
You know what that is?
Yeah.
Trouble.
Those vests are real nice.
Stop looking for trouble now.
Should have slapped your mouth.
Who stopped you?
Come on.
Give me one.
Just one.
I just want one vest.
You can get another one, man.
No chance.
You letting armies walk through here any time they want?
How will it look?
Get lost.
Soon, every gang will boogie right in, soldier right through.
I'll tell you, some man you are.
Take your colours off, you can walk through.
We don't do that.
It don't mean we're at war.
You go as civilians, or I gotta come down on you.
Take off your colours.
You hear me?
Fuck you.
We're not gonna hide who we are because some whore shakes her ass.
Don't call me no whore.
I ain't no whore!
Let's go.
We're marching to the next station, right through these lame fucks'territory.
Now, let's move.
Yeah.
That's right, Warriors.
Just keep walking.
Real tough mothers, ain't you?
You guys don't show me much.
Why don't you dickheads walk all the way home?
That chick's got some mouth.
You two were terrific.
You guys lipped them down, but good.
His ass gonna be ringin'for a month.
We should have wasted'em.
The station's this way.
Let me go!
Let me be!
What do you got in mind?
Maybe I'm looking for some real action.
What about me?
I got the big one.
I'll give it to you, baby.
Let her go.
You gonna jump me?
We ought to pull a train on you.
You look like you might like it.
Fuck you!
Real tough chick.
You see what you get when you mess with the Orphans?
We're gonna rain on you, Warriors!
Holy shit!
Now!
Move, move!
Where is everybody?
Come on!
Whoa!
Hold on!
Hey, wait a minute.
I got to ask a question.
How come we're running?
I told you, they're a bunch of wimps.
Union Station, here we come.
What about me?
So, what about you?
We got a report from the Bronx.
Some small-time clique ran into them.
The Orphans.
They're not on our network.
They rumble anyway.
They got wasted.
Let's get down to it, boppers.
We'll have to do better out there.
Our friends made it past a minor-league team.
Remember, boppers, be looking good.
All that's going on, eh?
Right.
Great.
Great.
Well?
Well?
Some outfit almost got them, but they got away.
We'll get them at th Street.
It'll be crawling with cops.
They're trying to get all the gangs in town.
Me and you included.
How come you're so happy?
I'm having a good time.
Let's go!
How much longer do we wait?
We could be here forever.
I'm sick of waiting for trains.
Vermin, sit down and shut up.
OK, OK.
Let's go!
Where?
Hey, hold it!
Come on!
Stop!
Take the uptown.
Make it!
Make it!
Wait up!
Come back here!
Hold it!
This way!
Over here!
That way!
Go!
Down the stairs.
Come on!
The street!
Far enough, already.
This way!
Oh, shit!
Run!
Just get outta here!
Move!
Goddamn you!
Let go of me!
Union Square!
What about the others?
We gotta go!
Keep after them!
Keep on!
Stop that train!
Where are they?
Maybe we'd better take off.
Yeah, right.
Did we lose these fucking clowns?
Look.
Holy shit!
Let's hit it.
Snow, with me!
Hey!
I can't make it!
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Good.
I'm sick of running from these wimps.
I'm gonna shove that bat up your ass and turn you into a popsicle.
Come on.
Fuckin'A!
Come on, Cowboy.
I figured they were wimps.
The latest sports news off the street, boppers.
The Baseball Furies dropped the ball, made an error.
Our friends are on second base, trying to make it home.
The inside word is the odds are against them.
Stay tuned, boppers.
Stay tuned.
Where is everybody?
We're the first ones here.
We'll have to sit and wait.
They'll show up.
Looks like something else showed up.
Hey!
Look at what you find in the big city.
We ain't got time.
Are you kidding?
Time's what we got plenty of.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
I guess she don't know parks ain't safe after dark.
We ain't got time.
We've got to get to Union Square.
Go ahead.
I'm gonna get a little ex ercise.
You never were very smart.
I'll tell you something, War Lord.
I'm smart enough.
And it's there for free.
You two comin'?
Come on, man.
There's plenty of women at home.
Maybe all of you are just goin'faggot.
You feelin'all right, lady?
You need a little help or something?
Why don't you sit down?
Keep me company.
Whatever you say, lady.
Look at those muscles.
I bet the chicks like those muscles.
Hey.
We better go back and look out for him.
He saved my ass back there.
I owe him.
OK, I'll go look for the others.
You wanna show me how you play with the chicks?
Yeah.
I'll show you how I play.
Hey!
Not so rough.
Come on.
We'll get it on.
You don't get it.
I like it rough.
Your nights in the park are over for a while.
You're under arrest.
Hey, come on, lady!
Kiss my ass!
Come on, lady!
You don't want to play around with me!
Let me out of this thing!
You hear me?
Goddamn it!
Let me go!
Let me go!
You can't do this to me!
Come on, you lousy bitch!
Fucking wimp!
What have we got here?
Only one there?
The others ran off.
Put this slime in the back.
Hey, wait!
There are cops all over the place.
Where's the Fox?
Cop grabbed him.
So how come you hung around?
I don't know.
Where'd you get the coat?
You ask a lot of questions.
Don't give me that.
I stole it.
Cops are looking for somebody in a pink top.
Real tough chick.
You said that before.
If you're still heading for Union Square, I'll show you where to grab the train.
OK, come on.
What is that?
Hold it!
Freeze!
Go on!
Move it!
Jesus!
Come on!
Run!
Is this the place?
I hate asking questions, but where's the dudes?
Chicks like you always got dudes.
They went up to the Bronx.
Don't worry about them.
They're lame, real cripples.
Come on.
When I got off that subway and saw you, I thought, "Baby, throw it my way." It's really great of you taking us in.
We know about the Warriors.
They're a heavy outfit.
How'd you hear about us?
Word gets around.
I guess we are pretty well-known.
Come on.
You're the first friendly faces we've seen tonight.
That's the way we are.
Let's party.
Get something going.
I can dig that.
You came to the right guys.
Oh, hurt me, hurt me.
Don't thank us, man.
Just relax.
Fall out.
Take your pick.
Thanks.
Great outfit.
What clique is this?
We're the Lizzies.
Lizzies.
Just great.
I like it.
Glad to hear it.
We got to come here more often.
Yeah, right.
That's right.
Got to.
Thanks a lot.
Looks like you're the winner.
Yeah, right.
How much longer we staying here?
What's your hurry?
We just got here.
Let's get back to Union Square.
They'll be worried about us.
In a minute.
No break in the action.
Can we stop for a minute?
My legs are getting tired.
Come on, just keep walkin'.
What's you're hurry?
Tryin'to set a world record?
Hey.
Just walk.
I'm walkin'.
Why don't you give me a break?
Be a little friendly.
I don't even know your name.
My name's Swan.
Why do you care about names so much?
I like telling my friends if there's somebody particular.
Why don't you just tie a mattress to your back?
You don't care where it is, do you?
What do you got against me?
You been picking on me all night.
You want the truth?
Sure, go ahead.
I don't like the way you live.
The way I live?
I keep hoping I'll run into something better.
What kind of crap is this?
You ain't any better than me.
You like how everything's going for you?
Maybe I do.
Friday nights are pretty good.
Saturday nights are better.
Can you even remember who you get on Friday and Saturday?
Sometimes I can, sometimes I can't.
Who gives a damn?
I see what's happening next door and down the block, belly hanging down, five kids, cockroaches in the cupboard.
I'll tell you what I want.
I want something now.
This is the life I got left.
You know what I mean?
You get it, Warrior?
Get it?
How do you like it?
Come on.
What's wrong?
Let's just get to the next station, OK?
No.
Please?
Come on.
Come on.
You're just part of everything happening tonight, and it's all bad.
Go back to wherever you came from.
Hey, little man, you wanna dance?
Be right with you, babe.
So you're the famous Warriors, the guys that shot Cyrus.
Shit!
The chicks are packed!
Watch it!
Shit!
Come on, Rembrandt!
Come on!
Oh, shit!
She cut me!
She cut me!
Look, man.
We've got to hold ourselves together.
If we go to pieces, somebody out there will get us.
They think we shot Cyrus.
What are you talking about?
They think we shot Cyrus.
Every gang must be looking for us.
Holy shit!
We won't make it back.
We'll make it.
We came this far.
We're gonna go the rest of the way.
Let's go to Union Square and tell the rest of the guys.
Hey.
Where's the rest of them?
Yeah, right.
Where's everybody else?
Cops got Ajax.
We don't know about Swan.
Oh, Jesus!
Are you sure about Ajax?
Real sure.
I bet he went out swinging.
We better go look for Swan.
God, I can't believe it.
This is shit.
I need to talk to you.
See that dude with the skates?
Over there.
He's after you.
He's got others with him.
I know they're on my ass.
But now they know I know it.
What are you gonna do?
Come on.
You change your mind fast.
I was rough on you back there.
I can take care of myself.
Sure.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
I can't go in there.
It's a men's room.
Are you kidding?
Let me down, kill that bastard!
Get him!
Swan!
What about our patrols?
So far, nothing.
But we've got somebody you ought to talk to.
He says he saw who shot Cyrus.
Big Cyrus, he was going to run the whole city.
What crap that was.
Cyrus was right about one thing.
It's all out there.
We've just got to figure out how to steal it.
Sounds great.
You've just got to figure out what's worth stealing.
OK, come on, let's go.
Let's get out of here.
What's this for?
I just hate seeing anything go to waste.
This is what we fought all night to get back to?
Maybe I'll just take off.
You know I like travelling, too.
Where have you ever been?
I've never been anywhere.
I just know I'd like it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Stay right on their ass.
Wait a couple seconds after we move, then cut out the other way.
Why can't I stay with you?
Just do what I tell you.
Come on!
I can take care of myself.
I proved that.
Come on.
Warriors!
Come out to play!
Warriors!
Come out to play!
Warriors!
Come out to play!
Warriors!
Come out to play!
Warriors!
Come out to play!
Everybody packed?
Yeah.
All of you stay behind me.
I'm gonna take them out to the sand.
What about you?
You ready?
Let's do it.
When we see the ocean, we figure we're home, we're safe.
This time, you got it wrong.
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you waste Cyrus?
No reason.
I just like doing things like that.
Let's do it, me and you.
One on one?
You're crazy.
You're dead, all of you, and you know it.
You're dead.
Swan!
Riffs!
Yeah, right!
You still looking for us?
We found who we're looking for.
No.
No!
It wasn't us.
It was them, the Warriors.
You Warriors are good, real good.
The best.
The rest is ours.
Good news, boppers.
The big alert has been called off.
It turns out the early reports were wrong, all wrong.
For that group that had a hard time getting home, sorry about that.
Cut his ass.
Go!
Now let's go!
Heads up!
Take him down!
That's it, that's it!
Hey, Coach, how you been?
Lynn Swann.
Now, why ain't I surprised...
to see you snoopin'around my football field first day of practice?
Well, that's because you got a good-lookin'football team.
Maybe good enough to add another national championship trophy to the old case downstairs.
That's kinda like my old man told me one time, Lynn.
"The only thing better than a crawfish dinner is five crawfish dinners." Hey, here comes the shithead.
It's clean.
It's cold.
Now that's what I call high-quality H .
h!
oh!
Right in the head!
It's over there!
Any unused magic in that legendary green playbook of yours, Red?
I may have a couple squirrelled away in there...
for a rainy day.
See what we got here.
Not exactly what I'd call constructive criticism.
Smell like you could use a shower, stinky.
h!
Listen, you-you could think what you want a-about my personal hygiene, but, please, don't-don't waste any water.
That-That's bad policy.
If you need to amuse yourself at my expense, just-just rough me up or something.
Fair enough.
Laski, get over here!
Yes, sir, Coach?
What is that moron doin'here?
Huh, huh?
Didn't I tell you as plain as I could speak to get rid of his ass last year?
Yes, sir, but I didn't think you were serious, Coach.
Besides, he does a great job.
Disrupting my football team, you idiot?
Eighteen years of this is enough!
Hey, Waterboy!
Yes, Mr Coach Beaulieu!
You're fired!
kay.
Get out of the way, you moron!
When I was just a little boy - I stood up to my daddy's knee - My papa said, son don't let the man get ya - And do what he done to me - Born on the bayou - h.
Born on the bayou...
Bobby Boucher, come give your mama a kiss.
Hi, Steve.
h.
Why you home so early, my precious angel?
Mama, s-somethin'bad happened today.
Somebody hurt you, my boy?
Who hurt you?
You tell Mama who hurt you.
Nobody, Mama.
It's just that...
I lost my position as the team's water distribution engineer.
Why, that's the best news I heard in a dog's age.
Now you be able to spend your days at home where you belong.
Yes, but...
l-I was...
I was thinkin', Mama, maybe l-I could...
I could try to-to get another waterboy job for-for a different team.
Don't you raise your voice to me, Bobby Boucher.
l-I wasn't raising my voice, Mama.
I don't like confrontation 'cause I'm a Virgo.
Who told you you was a Virgo?
Vicki Vallencourt, that-that-that-that girl.
A girl?
Bobby Boucher!
Don't you remember what your mama told you about girls?
I remember, Mama.
A girl was so nice out at Wasser's Creek this morning.
Really?
We looked for crawfish together.
Her's name's Vicki.
I don't ever want you associatin'with little girls.
Why not, Mama?
Because little girls are the devil!
Mama, it-it's just that I'm a waterboy.
The team gets thirsty, and I bring them the water.
They-They need the water, and I likes to be the one that brings it to them.
Yeah.
They like to give you a boot in the patoot for all your trouble.
Bobby, you don't have what they call "the social skills." People don't understand you.
That's why you never have any friends, except for your mama.
All I know is this, Jimmy: Next Friday, August at the Baton Rouge Exposition Center, I'm gonna open a can of whoop-ass on Herculon, and I'm gonna drive him back into whatever galaxy it is he came from.
And that's a promise!
Strong words from a strong man, Captain Insano.
Now let's take a call.
It's our old friend from Jackson's Bayou, Mr B.
Hello, Jim.
l-ls it possible to speak to Captain Insano?
Shoot, Mr B.
Captain Insano, I notice sometimes when you are wrestling...
or-or openin'up a can of whoop-ass, as you like to say...
You seem to be sweating quite profusely.
Yeah?
I was wondering if, perhaps, you might need...
the services of an experienced waterboy.
That's pretty cute.
How old are you, kid?
Eleven, twelve?
l-I am years old.
I guarantee, that guy's still a virgin.
h!
h, my God!
My mama said - That your life is a gift - And my mama said - This much weight you will lift - And my mama said leave those bad boys alone - And my mama said...
This is where they strip the ball from us.
And then we miss one tackle.
There, two tackles.
Joey drops the ball.
Whoops, he has time to pick it up and dust it off and run in for a touchdown...
before our guys even know what's goin'on.
Hello?
My name is Bobby Boucher.
And I am inquiring as to whether you have the need for an experienced waterboy...
on your upcoming season.
Nice suit.
Thank you.
l-l-l-lt was my daddy's.
Hold that thought.
Yeah.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Come on.
Come here.
Come here.
Come on.
Come on, everybody.
All right, this is it.
This is the play.
kay.
This is the play.
This is the play.
kay?
The quarterback.
Two receivers lined up to the left, one to the right.
There's a flanker lined up to the left behind the quarterback.
h, okay.
He gives the ball...
No, he doesn't get the ball.
The receiver goes all the way over there to the left.
nce the quarterback has the ball, he fakes to the left.
No.
He fakes to the right.
He doesn't fake.
He thinks about faking.
He pretends to fake.
I don't know where I am.
I can't breathe.
r, this room is getting smaller.
I have to sit down.
Hang on here.
Take some water.
All right, there.
This is good.
This is much better than what I serve.
That is the water that you serve to your players?
Uh-huh.
It is imperative that you allow me to be your waterboy.
I can't hire you.
I can't hire anybody with the...
You do not have to...
have to pay me.
l-I will do it for free.
Just promise me that you will never distribute the contents of that jug to any human person.
That's a deal.
It's a deal?
Thank you so-so much, Coach Klein.
l...
I will not let you down.
Good day.
Good day.
l-l-I'll see you at practice.
Boom, boom, boom, boom - Bang, bang, bang, bang - Boom, boom, boom, boom - Bang, bang, bang, bang Hey - Hey...
Quit hoggin'that.
Pass it over.
[Mumbling, Indistinct] kay.
Just have the defence run sprints.
Yo!
Water's better cold.
Yes, I agree, but to guarantee that the H is-is purified, i-it's good to use the heating source, Sterno.
It's like my mama always says, "Better safe than-than sorry." My mama says that too.
Aren't all mamas the same?
Yes.
Derek.
I kick the field goals around here.
Will you listen up?
I need your cooperation.
I need it now.
Is he gonna be-be all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He has his good days and his bad days.
Used to be an assistant coach at some big football school, but he had a mental breakdown or something.
Don't worry.
He'll snap out of it.
Let me know when it cools down, baby.
All right.
Yes.
Hey, did you all get a load of the new waterboy?
Let's make him feel right at home.
Jerry, go right.
Casey, go left.
Way left.
n one.
Ready?
Break!
Set!
Red,!
Red,!
Hut!
l-l-l-I think you zigged when you should've zagged on that play.
Sorry.
Hey, Waterboy, check this out.
Hey, Waterboy!
Check this out.
Yes.
Well, my, my, my.
Was my little aquatic engineer about to bash one of my football players?
Well, he spit in the c-c-cooler.
He happens to be a finely tuned athletic machine.
And I ain't gonna have him hit in the head by some idiot waterboy.
Do you understand me?
Are you all right?
What?
I wasn't gonna do nothin', Coach.
Well, you better do something.
You gotta defend yourself here, Bobby.
But they're-they're-they're finely tuned athletic machines.
I am not telling you to go on a shooting rampage.
But you have to stand up for yourself, or they're gonna ride you all season long.
Believe me, I've seen it myself.
Hey, moron!
Hey!
Moron!
Duh!
L-Look at me.
I'm the w-w-waterboy.
Duh!
I got a wooden spoon.
Duh!
Smell like you could use a shower, stinky.
You're fired!
Stop makin'fun of me.
Red, ready!
Hut!
Wow!
Damn!
I'm sorry.
Who that?
Who there?
So that's what openin'up a can of whoop-ass feels like.
Son, you just opened a whole case of whoop-ass.
I would be honoured if you play football for this team.
Me?
Play football?
Yes.
Thanks, but no thanks.
My mama won't let me play no football.
We're gonna go home.
You and l, we're gonna talk to Mama.
M-Mama said...
M-Mama said...
My mama said...
Mama said...
My mama said...
My mama say that...
She's gonna say yes.
Mmm, that snake looks delicious.
What part do you think I'm about to eat?
Uh, basically a snake don't have parts.
But, uh, if I had to call it anything, I would say it's his knee.
Great.
His knee.
And what are we having for dessert?
[Animal Chittering In Zapper] Squirrel.
Excellent.
Let's talk about Bobby playing football.
I don't like it, Mr Coach Klein.
I don't like it one bit.
You see, my boy is too delicate to be playin'"fool's ball"...
or whatever you call it...
with them gargantuans.
I don't think you understand, Mrs Boucher.
No, you don't understand me, Mr Coach Klein.
My boy is all I got left.
w!
Mama, here.
It's the brain pain, Coach.
You see, my husband Robert, one day back in pick up sticks, and me four months pregnant with this precious angel.
He decides he wants to go and help the foreign peoples.
He's gonna go and join the Peace Corps.
And he promise me that everything's gonna be okay.
Just like you promisin'me now.
But everything wasn't okay.
No.
He got lost in the middle of the Sahara Desert.
And he died.
He died!
Couldn't get no water, Coach.
He died of the dehydration.
And we were left all alone.
I would've gotten my daddy some water, but I was just a little baby inside Mama's stomach.
And now you wanna take away the only part of my Robert I have left.
But don't you want the only part you've got left to get a college education?
Nah.
Me, a college student?
Yes.
Bobby, think about it.
A whole new world will open to you.
Boy, Mama, that-that-that sounds nice.
Me-Me, a college man.
Coach, my Bobby's a sweet boy, but he ain't exactly what you'd call "college material," so don't you go fillin'his simple head with all those crazy dreams...
of school and college and things of that sort.
But Mama, l-I'm tired of everybody callin'me a dummy.
I'm-I'm tired of not havin'any friends.
And my ass is tired sittin'here jawin'all night.
I'm goin'to bed.
Nice to meet you, Mr Coach.
Good luck with your fool's ball.
Bobby, after you let Mr Coach out, you come into my bedroom.
Mama'll brush your hair.
You know, when I was your age, my mother told me not to get a tattoo...
of Roy rbison.
But what Mama don't know won't hurt her.
I trust you'll make the right decision.
h, yeah - Huh I'm - Gonna get under your skin - Sooner or later - Damn, I don't want that ass on the team.
Everybody's gonna laugh at us.
Everybody's already laughin'at us.
We ain't won a game since .
Sooner or later...
Hey!
What's up, baby?
Hey.
Where's your helmet?
Derek Wallace, they-they don't got no more helmets.
Here.
You can share mine.
Try it on, man.
See if it fits.
All right.
Thanks, friend.
What a dink.
Come on!
Huddle up!
All right, we have an announcement to make.
ur former waterboy, Bobby Boucher, is gonna play some linebacker for us.
oh, I'm a f-f-football player.
Coach, I'd like to tackle him right now, please.
Not yet.
All right, now I wanna work with the offence.
I wanna work with the defence.
Special teams, go with Farmer Fran, do some laps.
Shit.
Line up on the ball.
Let's go.
All right?
Third and ten.
Third and ten?
Yeah, you know, that's the offense's last opportunity...
to gain ten yards before they have to punt.
Gee, he's gonna run the option.
ption?
He ain't never gonna be able to figure this out, Coach.
Yes, he is.
Now, Bobby, you've waterboyed for years.
Didn't you occasionally watch the game?
h, I had a lot to k-keep me busy.
Checking the pH levels, refillin'the cups.
All right.
Well, then let's just keep it simple.
Casey.
I want you to tackle Casey...
like you did Gee yesterday.
Right now?
Right now!
Go!
Does he know about this?
Doesn't matter.
You're a warrior.
Go.
Boy, what you doin'?
All right.
Bobby, Bobby.
Don't be afraid to use all of your strength, you know?
He's resilient.
He's a resilient guy.
kay?
Come on.
Hey, Casey, I think he wanna make out with you.
kay, that's enough.
Thank you.
Is there any sport that you do watch?
You know, a physical sport?
Boxing?
Hockey?
Wrestling.
Wrestling!
Wrestling is good.
Who's your favourite wrestler?
Well, even though he was slightly discourteous to me recently, I'm gonna have to say Captain Insano.
kay, okay, I want you to do to Casey...
what Captain Insano does to the bad guy.
Go.
w!
w!
He poked me in the eye.
Captain Insano shows no mercy.
Bobby, where was the intensity that I saw yesterday?
That was no intensity.
You said it was all right to fight back, and l-I just started thinkin' about all the people who-who'd been mean to me over the years.
That's it.
That's it.
I want you to think about all those mean people.
They're gonna be your tackling fuel.
Tacklin'fuel.
We're gonna use them to play football.
Tacklin'fuel.
I want you to pretend that Casey...
Is insulting you.
Pretend?
I want you to visualize all those people that have been mean to you.
And then I want you to attack.
I want you to visualize and then attack.
Can you handle that?
I'll try.
He's gonna try.
What's the matter with you, boy?
You too s-s-stupid...
to do what your coach tells ya?
No!
No what?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Coach told me to pretend.
Bobby.
Bobby!
Can you do this for me every single game?
Can you do this?
Coach, not only will I do it for you.
l-l-l...
Yes, yes, I'll do it for ya.
So, uh, why you pick this class anyway?
It's pretty hard.
h, beautiful view.
Correct.
All right, all right!
Y'all shut up now!
Now, last week, we talked about...
the physiology of the animal brain...
as it pertains to aggression.
Now, is there anyone here that can tell me why...
most alligators are abnormally aggressive?
I know the answer to this question.
Raise your hand.
Anybody?
Anyone?
Yes, sir.
You, sir.
Mama says that alligators are ornery...
'cause they got all them teeth but no toothbrush.
Yo mama said, alligators are ornery 'cause they got all them teeth...
and no toothbrush.
Wow!
Anybody else?
Yes, sir.
You, sir.
Alligators are aggressive because of an enlarged medulla oblongata.
It's the sector of the brain which controls aggressive behaviour.
That is correct!
The medulla oblongata.
But Mama said...
The medulla oblongata...
is where anger, jealousy and aggression come from.
Now, is there anybody here can tell me where happiness comes from?
No, man.
Anyone?
All right, let's hear what Mama has to say on the subject.
Mama say that happiness is from magic rays of sunshine that come down when you feelin'blue.
Well, folks, Mama's wrong again.
No, Colonel Sanders, you're wrong.
oh!
Mama's right.
You're all wrong.
Mama's right.
Mama's right!
Somethin'wrong with his medulla oblongata.
It's okay to fight back.
Coach Klein said I could.
Mr Coach Klein said I could.
It's fine, fellas.
Well, Mud Dog fans, it's time to kick off...
another year of Mud Dog football.
With the weight of a -game losing streak on their back, everyone seems to be diggin'in for the long haul.
There's blood in the streets It's up to my ankles - There's blood in the streets It's up to my knee - Blood on the streets in the town of Chicago - Blood on the rise It's following me...
What you doin', Bobby?
h, Lord, that-that-that's some heavy-duty armpit saturation.
That's an early warning sign of the dehydration.
You gots to have H .
Please, for me.
Look, you need to stop worryin'about water, baby, and start worryin' about the game today, okay?
Here.
Now, just do whatever you did to Colonel Sanders, and you'll be fine.
l-I will, thank you.
L-l-I just...
I feel bad about lyin'to my mama.
I wonder what she's doin'right now.
...
And he's down with a three-yard kickoff return.
The Mud Dogs offence takes the field.
kay, come on, here we go.
Come on, everybody.
You can do it.
Gain some yards.
Put some points on the board.
Hey, Walter, I'll bet you bucks...
Gee Grenouille throws a touchdown pass on the first play.
Check it out.
Set, fool, hut!
You owe me bucks.
You said it was gonna be a touchdown pass, you crazy asshole.
Go, go, go, go!
Hold 'em, hold 'em, hold 'em.
kay, you can do it.
Come on.
Bobby, Bobby, this is just like we practised, okay?
kay, go, go, go.
Come on.
Watch where you're going, needle dick.
Set!
!
Time for retard to find out what college football's all about.
!
Check, check.
Red,!
Red,!
Needle dick!
Needle dick!
Needle dick!
Yeah!
Your name is needle dick.
I knew that this was a good idea.
Yes!
Time-out from the game.
What's he calling time-out for?
Man, what are you doin'?
Here, this is for you.
Enjoy.
Hey, Waterboy, you're fired!
Stop it!
Yes!
Bobby!
oh-la-la.
Yeah, man!
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
Slap hands!
Whatever.
Waterboy's killin''em.
He's the best tackler I've seen since Joe Montana.
Joe Montana was a quarterback, you idiot.
I said, "Joe Mantegna." We're tied at seven with seconds to go in the fourth quarter.
Eagle cover two.
Eagle cover two.
Ready?
Best of luck to you on-on-on the upcoming play.
I'll be playin'with your mama tonight.
Sixty-two.
Move, hut!
Bernard drops back.
Looks like a screen pass.
Sixty-two!
Sixty-two!
There you are!
Thank you.
Number is headed for the end zone.
He's at the the .
He's almost...
Man!
Touchdown!
Reds lead.
Dropkick.
Looks like Boucher knocked him out cold.
I love my mama very much.
Now you know that.
The waterboy handed them the game.
What an idiot.
Waterboy, you stink!
Nice job, shithead.
You just lost us the game.
I'm sorry.
Would you please still be my friend?
No!
Get away from me.
kay.
Excuse me?
May I help you?
Hey, stud.
Vicki Vallencourt, this is...
this is quite a pleasant surprise.
Yeah, well, I just got out of jail, and I heard you were playin'football.
Yes, well, l-l-I've...
Yes.
So, let's say we go and get somethin'to eat, catch up on things.
h, uh...
Mama's not a-a-a big fan of restaurants...
or of-of me going to one.
But if-if you'd like, sometimes, Mama, she, uh...
she like to...
on a Sunday afternoon...
There-There's a-a-a grill with the charcoal b-biscuits.
You want me to come to a barbecue?
Yes, that's it.
Sounds great.
And by the way, I hope you like what I did to y'all lawn mower.
You know that old hag that does astrology on Good Morning America, she really ought to pack it in.
Listen what she said for Sagittarius.
She goes: "You're gonna be faced with a difficult decision today." But the thing is-is-is, we're all faced with difficult decisions every day.
That's like sayin' you're gonna eat today.
Yeah, m-maybe...
by leaving her predictions vague and generalized, there's less of a chance of someone findin'out she's a phoney.
Whatever, college boy.
Don't say college boy.
Here comes Mama.
h, okay.
That looks nice, Mama.
Mmm, here you go, Vicki Vallencourt.
Thank you.
Mama, Vicki's an astrologist.
I don't believe in that sort of thing, personally.
Astronomy is one of the many tools of the devil.
You sure played great yesterday, Bobby.
What did my boy play great?
Uh, um...
Waterboy.
Yeah, waterboy.
He played...
He played waterboy great.
Everybody who was thirsty got a drink right away...
yesterday at the...
at the football game.
Fool's ball!
Bunch of overgrown monsters manhandling each other.
Remember when that man wanted you to play fool's ball, Bobby?
Yeah, l...
He...
Roy rbison...
Coach Klein.
l-l-I remember.
So, Bobby, did they ever catch that gorilla...
what escaped from the zoo and punched you in the eye?
No, Mama, he...
The-The search continues.
What would you think if Bobby did play football, Mrs Boucher?
Well, I wouldn't think much of it at all.
And to tell you the truth, I don't think much of you...
and all your snotty questions, Miss Vallencourt.
I'm quite disturbed to see that you're so interested in my boy.
I'm very, very interested in your boy, Mrs Boucher.
Really?
Mm.
Well, did he tell you about how much his feet smell?
Mama.
He has to wear two pair of socks.
Well, men are supposed to have stinky feet.
Well, are men supposed to wear pyjamas...
featuring a cartoon character by the name of Deputy Dog?
Mama, please.
Well, you know what?
I happen to find Deputy Dog to be...
very, very sexy.
Did he tell you about a little bedtime problem?
Mama, I'm beggin'you, don't.
That's his sheet back there.
If you'll excuse me, ladies, I'm gonna go hang myself.
Now you see what you done?
What I did?
Now you listen here, cupcake.
The "onliest" woman in my boy's life is me.
Nobody's gonna take him away, especially not some godless Jezebel like you.
h, yeah, well your Bobby is a grown man.
And guess what?
He can hang out with whoever he wants!
h, yes, he can.
Whoever he wants.
'Cept you!
Bobby, that-that woman is the devil.
I want you to stay away from her, you hear me?
Yes, Mama.
Now you come on inside before that little ol'witch casts a spell on us!
I'm sorry, Vicki Vallencourt.
Whatever.
If you want it, you got it You feed it, you love it - Say that you need it You never......
When we report on the S.C.L.S.U.
Mud Dogs here on Sportscenter, it's usually to add...
another number to their amazing losing streak, which now stands at .
But now, Bobby Boucher has given us another reason.
In the Mud Dog's latest loss this past Saturday, the amazing -year-old freshman set a new N.C.A.A.
record...
by sacking the quarterback times, shattering the old record of seven.
And, oh, by the way, Bobby Boucher is also the team's waterboy, which, of course, begs the question: What exactly are they putting in the water...
down in Jackson's Bayou, Louisiana?
There is a house in New rleans - They call The Rising Sun...
We're deadlocked at three with less than a minute to go.
We are one family with one dream.
There are of you on this team, not just one.
Bobby can't do this by himself.
Now get out there and make something happen!
All right, sacrifice your bodies.
Go, go, go!
Thank you.
Bobby, you're gonna have to do this by yourself...
because there is nobody on this team that's any good.
Now look, I can't stand losing any more.
We've got to win one game.
Can you go out there and make something happen?
Visualize and attack.
Yeah.
Visualize and attack.
Please!
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Please!
Central Kentucky's down to their third straight quarterback.
Good news, folks.
First-string quarterback, Tommy Gardner, does not have a broken neck.
Blue,!
Blue,!
Hut!
I forbid you to talk to that enchantress.
She's the devil!
She's not the devil.
She's the most beautiful woman in the world.
I never said she was the devil.
She's the most beautiful woman in the world.
h, please, don't hurt me!
Follow the...
Come on!
You crazy man!
kay, okay, okay!
It's a safety!
They win, they win, they win!
With the help of Boucher, the losing streak is over!
I'm so sorry, Mama.
Please, forgive me.
I love you so much, Mama.
I love you.
I love you too.
We won!
We won, baby!
It's gonna be a big party tonight, and you're going!
Me?
Party?
Yeah, baby!
Party!
Party!
Let's groove tonight - And share the spots and light - Hey!
Nice suit.
Thank you.
It was my daddy's.
Mama don't know I'm here, but I took these outta the icebox: Louisiana frog cakes.
Thanks.
Come on in.
Hey, Bobby Boucher!
Look who's here: Sergeant Stutter.
Want a beer?
I'll take a Scotch and water.
Hold the Scotch.
You just make a joke, Bobby?
Yes, I did.
Good one.
Now that you finally won a game, right, you feel looser, the pressure is off, and that will lead to a lot more victories.
Yeah, that and a waterboy getting sacks a game.
That too.
Professor!
We still havin'that test on amphibians and reptiles next Friday?
Yes, sir.
That is, if it's all right with you.
f course, it is.
My best regards to your dear mama.
Let's talk to the waterboy.
You played amazing at the game today, Bobby.
And you are so cute.
Is there a girl you're seein'?
Seein'?
Uh, uh, I see a lot of girls.
I see a lot of guys too.
I think that's sexy.
You ever been with a guy and a girl at the same time?
h, yeah, plenty of times.
The other night, I was with my mama and Coach Klein at the same time.
You are a bad boy.
I wish you were my boyfriend.
h, thank you, but, see, there's this girl, Vicki Vallencourt.
She may be the devil.
Mama said that.
Consequently, I am prohibited from contact with her.
But I hope to get past that one day 'cause she's nice to talk to.
h, oh.
...
Take me and break me off Baby, let me play the clothes and I'll take me off - 'Cause I've been checkin'out your style from across the stand - And I'm much more than your waterboy and average fan - You ask me why Perfect practise makes perfect game - ...
Sit-ups and pull-ups octane, premium, fill up - I'm doin'my thing for much more than the thing - I'm doin'my thing for much more than the thing - I'm doin'my thing for much more than the thing - I'm doin'my thing for much more than the thing - I'm doin'my thing for much more than the thing...
Yo, we have a very special guest here today.
Let's have a warm L.T.
welcome for Bobby Boucher.
Come on, Bobby.
Thank you, Mr Lawrence Taylor.
Tell me, what is your secret?
How do you find yourself in the right position all the time?
That-That-That's a good question.
What-What happens is, the-the-the centre has-has the ball first.
And-And-And the quarterback will say, "Hike." That's when the c-center puts the ball in-into the hands of the quarterback.
So what I do is, l-I start tacklin'the quarterback, unless he give the ball to-to s-somebody else, in which case, l-I try to tackle that person.
Hmm?
Gentleman, which brings me to my next point: Don't smoke crack.
Vicki Vallencourt.
What you doin'here?
h, nothin'.
I was just thinkin'...
about stealin'L.T.
's Porsche over there.
But I suppose I ought to be movin'on before I get you in trouble with your mama.
Well, Mr Coach Klein said that what Mama don't know won't hurt her.
So maybe we could ride home together.
Really?
If you'd like to.
kay.
Who got the hooch...
Who got the hooch Baby - Who got the only sweetest thing in the world - Who got the hooch, baby - Who got the only sweetest thing in the world - Who got the love Who got the freshy freshy - Who got the only sweetest thing - In the world...
You can sit down, if you'd like.
Vicki Vallencourt, I figured...
'cause you're interested in astrology and mystical stuff like that, you might appreciate this.
That's water from a glacier in Alaska.
It-lt was blessed by a-an Eskimo medicine man.
It's cold!
Yes, it's always cold.
That's why it's so special.
That-That was...
That-That-That-That happened...
That-That happened to be my-my first time with-with lips...
and-and-and-and-and and-and-and-and-and the-the tongue.
That was your tongue.
l...
I believe it was...
I never did that before.
Well, if that was your first kiss, then I bet it's the first time you've seen a pair of these.
Yes, yes, that is a-another first for me, and l-I appreciate what-what-what you're showin'me right now.
Vicki-Vicki Vallencourt, l-I think Mama's up.
Devil, devil, devil.
You better get goin'.
My God, Bobby, I mean, sometimes, I just don't know why I bother with you.
You ain't even a man.
It looks like the Cinderella S.C.L.S.U.
Mud Dogs, led by linebacker Bobby Boucher, are gonna fall one victory short of that Bourbon Bowl bid.
Iowa could win the game by nailing this -yard field goal.
Yeah, but the Mud Dogs have played a sensational football game.
Let's take a look at the way Boucher entered the Hawkeyes'last drive.
Here we see Boucher instantly penetratin'the pocket.
There's a lot of pain and shame in those eyes.
Friends, it's all over.
My leg!
Wow, that is a disturbing image.
Difficult to watch, Chris.
Whoo!
My God!
Gonna kick some names and take some ass!
Bobby!
Water sucks.
Gatorade is better.
What?
Use it on the field.
Waterboy, Waterboy, Waterboy!
Gatorade not only quenches your thirst better, it tastes better, too, idiot.
You're-You're-You're drinkin' the wrong water.
Gatorade.
H .
Gatorade!
H!
Water sucks, It really, really sucks Water sucks - It really, really sucks...
Stop saying that.
You don't mean that.
You're bad people.
And my friend, Chris, the Mud Dogs are goin' to the Bourbon Bowl.
With yesterday's come-from-behind victory, the S.C.L.S.U.
Mud Dogs...
earned a New Year's Day date with Red Beaulieu and the Louisiana Cougars...
in the first annual Bourbon Bowl.
But not only has the waterboy changed S.C.L.S.U.
's fortunes, he's got other teams looking around the sidelines for talent.
In fact, yesterday, Michigan, devastated by injury, experimented with their towel boy at wide receiver.
But the towel boy ran into a laundry list of problems.
You know, when I see so many of you here tonight, it reminds me just about how special this season really was.
Not just for the team.
Not just for the students.
But for each and every one of you...
in our small corner of Louisiana!
You can do it!
h, yes, we can, and, yes, we will.
Because we've got...
a young man who has been so vital to our success.
A wonderful student-athlete.
And a wonderful friend.
Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby Boucher!
...
Waterboy, number one!
You can do it!
Thank you so much...
for bein'my friends.
You can do it!
I'd also like to take this opportunity...
to tell you that my mama don't know how I play football, so if-if you could not tell my mama l-I play football, that would be for the best.
...
We must be a little lost.
We're tryin' to get to the Bourbon Bowl.
Looks like we ended up in Retardville, U.S.A.
Hey, Waterboy, you fixin' to tackle all of us?
Kick his water-lovin'ass, Greg.
I asked you a question, dumb ass.
You even exhale, and I will saw your head off.
You can do it!
Cut his fucking head off!
Hold it, hold it.
Just a minute.
Now what is the problem here, honey?
I mean, whatever it is, we don't want this to get physical.
Right, Klein?
Yeah, well, your team actin' like a bunch of shitheads.
This is not how ambassadors for the University of Louisiana are supposed to act.
So now you just get back on the bus.
However, assault with a deadly weapon, very, very serious offence.
fficer, get her little country ass outta here.
Thank you, Vicki.
Let's go.
Ah!
It's the waterboy!
I got something for you.
This is his transcript from South Lafayette High School...
in Cherokee Plains, Louisiana.
Now, the problem with that...
is there ain't no South Lafayette High School in Cherokee Plains, Louisiana.
So obviously, this is a fake!
However, this is not a fake.
This is from the N.C.A.A.
They don't think you ought to play football no more.
So allow me to say this to you one more time: You're fired.
h, no!
We suck again!
Ever see a championship ring?
Don't be messin'with the champ.
Come on, Laski.
You didn't go to high school?
I was home schooled.
l-I didn't know I needed...
Forged a fake transcript.
No, no, l-l-I didn't.
The waterboy's a cheater.
Cut his head off.
Listen, everybody!
This don't change nothin'!
We played as a team, we won as a team.
And just because the waterboy's a cheater, don't change the fact that the real Mud Dogs...
are gonna kick some Cougar ass.
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
That's the way!
Sorry, Bobby.
h, what a lonely boy - Believe me, l-I understand.
Yeah, and you're deeply appreciated, Mr Dodd.
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.
Good news, Bobby.
The N.C.A.A.
is gonna allow you to play in the Bourbon Bowl.
Yes.
You just have to pass the high school equivalency test.
It's not the test, Coach.
Everybody hates me.
That's not true.
ne man said he wanted to decapitate me.
Nobody else thought that to be too bad of an idea.
Somebody made me look like a-a-a cheater.
I did it.
I did it.
I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
It was me.
Why?
Because I wanted you to play.
Because you were my way out, Bobby.
'Cause it was the only way to get you in.
I am so sorry.
Why didn't you s-stick up for me down by the river?
The truth is, I fled.
I came into my office, I went under my desk, I cried.
I cried.
I cried like a ten-year-old girl!
Red and I have a history.
Twenty years ago, we were assistants to Coach Cavanaugh...
at the University of Louisiana.
Red ran the practices, and I used to come up with the plays.
h, boy, was I good.
I would write these foolproof plays in my little green notebook that I had.
The opposition didn't even know what hit 'em.
And when Coach Cavanaugh was going to retire, me and Red, we just knew that one of us was gonna be his successor.
...
Hey, Red.
How ya doin'?
Come by to wish me luck?
Well, not exactly, no, no.
Actually, I come by to get you to do ol'Red a little favour.
Sure.
What's up?
Well, you know that green notebook you use to write all them football plays in?
Well, I need to show Cavanaugh that I can come up with some good play ideas.
But you didn't come up with them.
They're my plays.
I need them.
Klein, I'm gonna have this book one way or another, so you might as well let the damn thing go, 'cause if you don't, it's gonna get awfully, awfully physical around here.
And I don't think you want that, do you?
Huh?
f course, Red got the job.
Next day, fired me.
nce he had my notebook, he didn't need me any more.
I didn't take it very well.
No, Grandma, I didn't get it.
I can't believe it myself.
I know.
I'm so numb.
I just hate him, I hate him, I hate him.
That is a terrible story, Coach.
But why-why don't you just come up with some new plays?
I tried.
I can't.
Yes.
I guess I have a mental block, you know, ever since Red took my playbook and my manhood.
I knew what he was gonna do!
And I just didn't fight back.
Well, you're gonna show him that you're a man on Saturday.
And I'm gonna show everybody that I'm not a dummy.
I'm gonna go study.
...
Mama, maybe you could stop brushin' my hair so I can read.
Read?
You don't have to read.
What you readin'for?
'Cause I enjoys it, Mama.
Don't look like to me you enjoys it, sittin'there all grouchy.
Mama, I gotta read this book and six other books tonight, or else I can't play foot...
ball.
Fool's ball?
You playin' the fool's ball behind my back?
The only reason I'm doin'this so, so I can go to school.
School?
You goin'to school?
Sorry, Mama.
I wanted to tell you.
You off gallivantin'with your fancy fool's ball friends at school, while I'm sittin'here all day with nobody to keep me company, except Steve?
The chickens are comin'home to roost, Bobby Boucher.
You reap the fruit of your selfish ways.
You're gonna lose all your fancy fool's ball games...
and you're gonna fail your big exam, because school is...
The devil?
Everything is the devil to you, Mama!
Well, I like school, and I like football!
And I'm gonna keep doin'them both because they make me feel good!
And by the way, Mama, alligators are ornery...
because of their medulla oblongata!
And I like Vicki, and she likes me back!
And she showed me her boobies, and I liked them too!
The Louisiana High School Equivalency Examination...
consists of multiple choice questions.
You have three hours.
Good luck to you, sir.
Well, I was born in a small town - And I live in a small town - If I could die in a small town - r the small communities - Ben Franklin.
Mama, when did Ben Franklin invent electricity?
That's nonsense!
I invented electricity.
Ben Franklin is the devil!
I can't believe you got a!
l-l-I can't believe that l-l-I told Mama...
that I got feelings for you.
Well, welcome to your manhood, Bobby Boucher.
When we get a little more time, I'll welcome you properly.
Yes, once again, I'm not quite sure what that means, but...
You know, we should get goin'.
I told the coach that I'd drive to the game with him.
I was with you from two to four last night.
You-You tell them.
Bobby, your mama got sick this mornin'.
She's in the hospital.
Mama, what have I done?
I'm so sorry, Mama.
Doctors say...
they can't figure out what's wrong with her.
But I know what's wrong.
She got a broken heart because of me.
Bobby, that's ridiculous.
Everybody else in this town turn on me at the drop of a hat.
Mama is the only one who really cares if I live or die.
She my whole world.
Will you just leave us alone?
She'll be fine, Bobby.
We better get going.
God knows what the team is doing with just Farmer Fran watching them.
...
[Woman n P.A., Indistinct] Everybody parties on the New Year's Eve - You really made it look like home.
Waiting for the countdown - Make a lot of promises they never keep - Party with the lights on - How's that, Steve?
Holding a glass of champagne - Everyone having fun - Trying to get out of the rain - Everybody parties on the New Year's Eve - Party with the lights on - Take a look.
The crowd has never been bigger.
You know why?
Look who's on the television, Mama.
The devil.
intimate...
Party on New Year's Eve - Tell me what to see - The peak of the holiday season - Everything's all right with me - Who there?
Who there?
Bringing in a new year...
Three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year, Mama.
...
My resolution is to never hurt you again.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot - And days of auld lang syne...
Waterboy!
Waterboy!
Waterboy!
Waterboy!
Bobby Boucher, all these folks are here tonight...
to tell you that they're sorry...
that they're sorry for not supportin'you...
when it meant the most.
But you do have friends, and one of 'em wants to say somethin'.
Come on.
I am not what you would call a handsome man.
The good Lord chose not to bless me with...
with charm, athletic ability or a fully functional brain.
You see, you're an inspiration...
to all of us who, who weren't born handsome...
and charming and cool and...
I can't!
I can't!
It's okay.
Bobby, if your mama could only hear us right now, we would tell her...
what a fine boy she raised, and how much your playing football means to this town.
But she can't hear you, 'cause she's unconscious.
I'm sorry to disappoint you all, but please keep your voices down...
so my mama can get her rest.
Well, wake her ass up!
We gotta win tomorrow!
[Woman n P.A., Indistinct] Mama!
Thank God, you're okay.
I'm so sorry.
I was so bad, Mama.
You were right about everything.
I've been a real knucklehead.
h, hush, baby.
You should've seen this a long time ago.
h, my word!
Is that my daddy?
No, no.
That's a guy I dated before I met your father.
h, you could iron a shirt on his stomach.
Well, that was lust, not love.
Turn the page.
There's your daddy.
So handsome.
h.
Read on.
"Dear Helen." Who's Helen?
That's my first name, Bobby.
hh!
"I have arrived here in New rleans.
"It is even more beautiful than in the picture books.
"I'm sure I'll have no problem finding work, "so you can expect my next letter to contain lots of money.
Your loving husband, Robert." That's nice, Mama.
"Dear Helen." That's you.
"I found a job as a lemonade vendor, "but sorry, no money yet.
"New rleans is an expensive city.
"Expensive, but fun.
Hope all is well.
Robert." "To Whom It May Concern: "This will be my last letter.
"We have grown apart over these last six weeks.
"I now have two loves in my life: "big-city livin'and a voodoo woman named Phyllis.
Ciao, Roberto." He changed his name to Roberto.
I guess he thought it was more exotic.
But Mama says that...
I mean, you say that...
Bobby, your daddy didn't go into no Peace Corps.
He deserted us, baby.
No, no, Mama.
You-You...
You shouldn't be dredgin'up these painful memories in your condition.
h, hush.
Your mama's as healthy as an ox, and as dumb as one to boot.
I was so scared you'd abandon me too.
And I made you abandon all those people who depend on ya.
I hid you away from the world, Bobby Boucher.
But I can't hog you to myself no more, because everyone's seen how wonderful you are.
h, Mama!
Now.
You go play fool's ball with your friends.
Welcome to ABC's coverage of the Bourbon Bowl.
Good afternoon, everybody.
I'm Brent Musburger, along with my colleague, Dan Fouts.
And the big story here, Dan, is a game that's lost some of its lustre...
without its star player, the waterboy Bobby Boucher.
You know, Red's got a couple of solid early rounders out there.
I know, but I really wanted to scout that waterboy.
Reminds me of Greg Lloyd.
Naw.
"Zack" Thomas.
Whatever.
Is she ready?
h, yeah.
She's more than ready.
Come on, Bobby!
You'll miss the boat!
Let's go, ladies.
We are underway!
The opening kickoff is a beauty!
Holdsworth is gonna bring it out from nine yards deep.
Come on.
Yeah!
Dan, they're showing no respect for this team without Boucher.
Good reason, Brent.
yards untouched.
Touchdown, Cougars!
They strike first.
Time running down in the first quarter.
Cougars lead is .
Set!
Three!
Thirty-three!
Three!
Thirty-three!
Hut!
Dan, that quarterback can't even get the ball off before he's hit.
It's as if they're in the offensive huddle with him.
Are you gonna finish that hot dog, Jimmy?
Ugh!
Now I'm not.
Mama, you think we'll make it on time?
Hang on!
I'll show you what A.J.
Foyt taught me.
That's the end of the half.
The Cougars are dominating.
Let's hope the Mud Dogs can make some adjustments.
Well, they better, 'cause they suck.
Mm-hmm.
Anybody got an idea?
Hey.
Remember the time Bobby tackled the referee by mistake?
Yeah, that was pretty funny.
How about the time he tackled the guy from Louisville...
And threw him into the stands?
Y'all remember when he intercepted the ball and his pants fell off?
And then he ran for the touchdown, bare-assed.
Remember the time Bobby...
Remember when Bobby Boucher showed up at halftime and the Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl?
Hey, sorry about givin'you so much shit this year.
You're the heart and soul of this team, Bobby.
And the only one of us who could've passed that test.
Thank you all so much for being my friends.
Well, let's wait till later to hold hands and kiss.
We got a Bowl game to win.
Right?
Yeah!
Two, three!
Mud Dogs!
Woof!
In a dramatic turn of events, Bobby Boucher just arrived at halftime.
And on a fan boat, Brent.
His mother drove him right into the stadium.
[Players Shouting, Hooting] Waterboy!
Waterboy!
Waterboy!
Waterboy!
Waterboy!
Waterboy!
Fool's ball's not for the devil.
It's for my Bobby.
Time to open up some whoop-ass.
[Cheering, Chanting Continues] Shit, he showed up.
All right, look.
Just relax.
Relax.
Go in there and do exactly like we planned.
Go, go, go!
This could be the start of some high drama, folks.
r are the Mud Dogs too far behind?
Bobby Boucher is on defence.
The Cougars are coming out from their own yard line.
Hut!
Hut!
The pitch.
It's a reverse!
Boucher's not fooled.
Fumble!
Robideaux's got it!
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!
Boy, Boucher knocked the poop out of him.
"Poop"?
Slap hands!
Slap hands!
Drink up, now.
I want you girls to sober up.
Have faith in my Bobby.
The Mud Dogs are faced with yet another third and long.
Hut!
Grenouille back to pass.
He's gonna be stuffed again!
And the Mud Dogs offence is still unable to move that ball.
But the way their defence is fired up, they still have a shot at winning this game.
Blake, come here.
Look.
Now, what if we, uh...
Trust me.
Go, go, go, go, go.
The Cougars lead in the middle of the third quarter.
And he takes a knee?
Y'all gonna play or what?
How do you all like my new offence?
All right, it's second and ...
As the Cougars line up on the ball.
Hut!
Hut!
What is Red Beaulieu doing, refusing to play offence?
Dan, this is bizarre.
No, it's not, Brent.
It's brilliant, because Red is taking the waterboy out of the game.
By kneeling down three times and punting, he's gonna make the Mud Dog offence try to beat him.
And the way they're playing today, that's impossible.
Well, the Mud Dog's most valuable player, the linebacker they call "the Waterboy," is now powerless.
That means Coach Klein will have to find another way to outfox Red.
Mud Dogs call a time-out.
Mr Coach Klein.
Mr Coach Klein!
Mr Coach Klein!
Where are you going?
I was just gonna get a hot pretzel.
Mr Coach Klein, are you afraid of Red Beaulieu?
I am petrified of him.
Well, why don't you pretend that Red Beaulieu...
is somebody that you're-you're not afraid of.
Pretend?
Yes.
Visualize somebody you're not afraid of.
And then attack, like you told me.
I'll try.
Well, he's right over there.
Little baby.
Yeah.
Hello, little baby.
A poo-poo?
Do you have a poo-poo?
Yes.
kay.
Now.
This is what we're gonna do.
He's gonna come here...
Come and get this one, Cougars.
Red,!
Hike!
Snap to Grenouille.
A reverse!
No, it's a double reverse!
h, what a block!
And Boudier springs free!
Trouble!
Lateral!
Got him!
What a play!
Grenouille to the!
To the!
To the!
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!
Well, well, well.
I guess Coach Klein does have a few tricks up his sleeve after all.
What the hell...
What the hell is this?
Huh?
We go from a championship football team to a bunch of dogs!
Right now, we're going to go down to the sidelines and our man, Lynn Swann.
Swannie, what do you have for us?
I'm with Vicki Vallencourt, who's taking over...
Bobby Boucher's water duties for this important game.
h, I'm not takin'over.
I'm just tryin'not to screw up too bad.
Well, let me ask you this.
What's your prediction for the rest of this ball game?
Mud Dogs are gonna win, to .
That's very interesting.
How'd you come up with that guess?
Guess?
That ain't no guess!
That's what it's gonna be.
kay.
That's fine.
h!
Be careful down there, Swannie.
All right.
Meaney.
Where's Meaney?
Meaney?
Here, Coach.
Get in there and let's see if that waterboy can stop you.
Yes, sir!
Red is sending his best defender in as a running back?
What do you make of this, Dan?
Well, Brent, he's gotta find some way to neutralize the waterboy.
He probably thinks that Meaney will just pound it in there like Fridge used to do for the Bears.
Hey, Waterboy!
Is your girlfriend gonna save you again?
h, no, sir.
I'm gonna take matters into my own hands.
You'll see.
Bring it to the hole!
Your ass is mine!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
You sound like a...
a big choo-choo train.
Whoo!
Power bomb, compliments of Captain Insano.
Let's go fight with your might...
All right, field goal.
Field goal.
Go.
Derek.
Derek!
Yeah.
Visualize the attack.
Go kick the ball.
Kick it.
Hut!
How you doin', boy?
No, no, no!
[Players Shouting, Indistinct] What the hell is that?
Where the hell is...
What the hell is he up to?
That ain't in here!
Huh?
Hey!
Down by ten late in the fourth quarter, Coach Klein opts for the field goal.
Then they have to hope for the onside kick and a touchdown to tie the game.
Dan, look what we have here.
Boucher's in the game as a blocker.
Last game of the year, Brent.
Can't hold anything back now.
Set!
The snap.
It's a fake!
Boucher's out in front!
A great block!
And a second one!
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!
Boucher led him all the way!
Yeah!
Red Beaulieu is steaming, Dan.
Brent, he sees his perfect season slipping away.
The Cougar's lead is down to three.
[Cheerleaders Cheering, Indistinct] The Mud Dogs need the ball back if they're gonna have a shot at overtime.
And Bobby Boucher is now on the kickoff team.
Last game of the year, Brent.
Can't hold anything back now.
I know.
Who's it gonna be?
Who's it gonna be?
Who's it gonna be?
h, yeah.
There's my bitch.
Remember, the ball must travel ten yards.
It's loose!
Mud Dogs football!
Mud Dogs football!
All right!
Mama, I got the football!
I got it...
h, what a vicious hit!
That was a cheap shot.
h!
And what a dumb penalty.
That puts the Mud Dogs in field goal range for the tie.
Dan, I'm not sure that Boucher is able to get back up.
h, my baby!
It's still cold.
Excuse me.
ut of my way.
Dan, you hate to see this happen.
Now, that's high quality H .
You go on, now!
Make it happen, Bobby!
The waterboy just needed some water.
Wow, Dan.
You think that up all by yourself?
Shut up, Brent.
Are you okay?
He tried to open up a can of whoop-ass on me.
I wouldn't let him.
Listen, I have an idea for the last play.
You haven't done this before.
All right?
The offence is gonna line up like this.
Yeah.
You're gonna be right here.
There'll be no tie here today.
Coach Klein is sending his offence back on to the field.
He's going for the win right now.
Yeah, this is a real gutsy call, Brent.
He'll either be a hero or a goat because of this.
And Dan, Bobby Boucher is back on the field.
He is now playing offence!
We know.
We know.
Meaney, if they give that Waterboy the football, I don't care if you have to stab him!
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir!
Do you understand me?
Get in there!
Break!
I'm ready, friend.
Let's do it, Bobby.
Set!
Set!
Forty-three!
Set!
Forty-three!
Hut, hut!
Touchdown!
They win it!
The Mud Dogs win it!
Bobby Boucher's the hero!
He's gone from waterboy, Dan, to saviour!
And it's because he didn't hold anything back!
Well, Swannie's down on the field with our hero, so let's go to Lynn now!
We did it!
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
Vicki, I love you!
Whoo!
I love you, too, baby.
We're the champions!
Mr Coach Klein, you got your manhood!
You got your manhood!
Bobby, congratulations.
You're the M.V.P.
of the Bourbon Bowl.
How do you feel?
I love Mama!
There you go, Bobby!
Lookin'sharp, Bobby!
You the man, Bobby!
Bobby, I've been dreading this day for a long time.
But you got yourself a fine woman.
h, thank you, Mama.
Good luck, son.
This is the best day of my life!
You just wait till tonight.
What's gonna happen tonight?
You'll see.
You can do it!
You can do it all night long!
I'm gonna go do it!
Bobby, it's me!
Your daddy, Roberto.
Daddy?
I've seen you on the ESPN when they was talkin'about you being drafted by the NFL.
Not going to the NFL.
I'm gonna stay in school and graduate.
The hell with school, dopey!
Take the money!
You and me could be partners, Just like that Tiger Woods and his daddy.
Uh-oh.
Nice hit, Mama.
Thanks, baby.
Now, you go on and have some fun becoming a man.
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...
What the hell...?
Hey, my turn.
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?
Nice night for a walk?
Nice night for a walk.
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

Right.
I think this guy's a couple of cans short of a six-pack.

Now.
Fuck you, asshole.
Hey, buddy, did you just see a real bright light?
See that guy?
Hold it right there.
He's rabbiting.
Hey!
I said hold it!
Go.
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.
What day is it?
The date.
1 2th May.
Thursday.
What year?
He's got my gun.
Let's go.
Guard it for me, Big Buns.
Hi.

So am l.

Honey, can I have that coffee now?

That's mine, but I didn't order fries.
Mine's the chilli beef deluxe.
Who gets the burly-beef?
We're ready to order now.
yes, ma'am.
I'm so sorry.
This isn't real leather, is it?
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.
Look at it this way.
In 100 years, who's gonna care?
The 1 2-gauge auto-loader.
That's ltalian.

The 45 long slide with laser sighting.
These are new.
We just got them in.
That's a good gun.
The beam comes on you put the red dot where you want the bullet to go.
you can't miss.
Anything else?
Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.
Hey, just what you see, pal.
The Uzi nine millimetre.
you know your weapons, buddy.
Any one of these is ideal for home defence.
So which will it be?
All.
I may close early today.
It's a 1 5-day wait on the handguns, but the rifles you can take now.
you can't do that.
Wrong.
Hi, baby.
yeah, yeah, it's me.
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me.
What the...?
Hey, man, you got a serious attitude problem.
Sarah Connor?
yes?
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.
Sarah, come here.
It's about you.
I mean, sort of.
Incredible.
you're not gonna believe this.
you're going to love this.
What?
..compiled from several witnesses.
Once again, Sarah Connor, 35, mother oftwo, brutally shot to death this afternoon.
you're dead, honey.
..if you're into sound, for the greatest sound around, come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.
We've got woofers, tweeters, the newest in audio and compact discs.
We've got graphic equalisers and sound balancers that...
Sorry.
Hello?
First I'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse one by one, then run my tongue down your neck to your bare, gleaming breasts.
And then slowly...
slowly pull yourjeans offinch by inch.
Ginger, it's Matt.
And lick your belly in circles further and further down, and then pull your panties off with my teeth.
Who is this?
God.
Sarah?
Jesus.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger?
Sure.
It's the creep.
Hello?
First I'll rip the buttons off your blouse one by one...
you fucking pigs.
Wait till I get my hands on you.
Get off me.
Ed.
What have you got?
Dead girl.
I can see that.
Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.
Shot six times at less than 10 feet.
Large calibre weapon.
you know, these work.
What's this?
Dead girl two.
Sent over from the Valley division this afternoon.
Are you sure there's a point to all of this?
Look at the name, Ed.
Sarah Louise Connor.
Is this right?
you're kidding.
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.
A one-day pattern killer.
I hate the weird ones.
So...
Better than mortal man deserves.
Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
Not lately.
Did you check messages?
I thought you did.
Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
There you are, young man.
you mind your mother.
Hi, Sarah.
Stan Morsky.
Something's come up.
Looks like I won't be able to make it tonight.
Just can't get out ofit.
I'm really sorry.
I'll make it up to you.
Call you in a day or so.
Bye.
That bum.
So what if he has a Porsche?
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.
I'll live.
I'll break his kneecaps.
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?
God.
It's disgusting.
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.
We will.
you, too.
OK.
Damn it, Matt.
Shit.
These killings occurred in the order of their listings in the phone book.
What can I tell you?
No comment.
But, Lieutenant...
That coffee's two hours cold.
I put a cigarette out in it.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
No.
I got her answering machine.
Send a unit.
I sent a unit.
There's no answer.
The apartment manager's not in.
Call her.
I just called her.
Call her again.
Give me a cigarette.
Hi, there.
Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.
But don't be shy.
It's OK.
Machines need love, too, so talk to it...
Same shit.
I can hear it now.
He's gonna be called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.
Where are you going?
To make a statement.
Maybe make these jackals work for us.
If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock, maybe she'll call us.
Well, how do I look?
Like shit, boss.
your mama.
This just in.
Police have announced the name ofthe victim in the second oftwo murders which took place today.
Incredibly, the names ofthe two victims are virtually identical.
Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann Connor was pronounced dead...
Can we change this?
Sarah Louise...
Don't touch it.
Police are refusing to speculate on the similarity between the shooting deaths and no other connection between the two victims has been established yet.
We'll have more on this late-breaking story as it comes in.
Hey, you got a phone?
It's in the back.
Hey.
Four-fifty.
You have reached the Los Angeles Police emergency number.
All lines are busy.
Ifyou need a police car sent out to you, stay on the line.
Go on.
I'm gonna make a belt out of you.
Don't make me bust you up, man.
Hi, there.
Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.
But don't be shy.
It's OK.
Machines need love, too.
So talk to it and Ginger, that's me, or Sarah will get back to you.
Wait for the beep.
This is Sarah.
Pick up ifyou're there.
I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard called Tech Noir.
I'm really scared.
I think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.
I need you and Matt to come and pick me up as soon as possible.
The police keep transferring me.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.
The number here is 555 9175.
Call me, kiddo.
I need your help.
It's her.
Sarah Connor?
It's Lieutenant Traxler.
Don't put me on hold.
Don't transfer me to another department.
I won't.
Can you tell me where you are?
I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.
I know it.
It's on Pico.
Are you all right?
yeah, but I don't wanna leave.
I think there's a guy following me.
Now, listen carefully.
you're in a public place so you'll be safe.
Stay visible.
Don't go outside.
I'll have a car there in a minute.
OK.
Hey, that guy didn't pay.
Come with me if you wanna live.
Come on!
This is one-L-19.
I got a hit-and-run felony.
Suspect vehicle Iate model grey Ford headed westbound on Seven.
He's really moving punching lights.
I'm gonna need an ambulance at Seventh and Broadway right now.
Hold it.
Hold on.
Are you injured?
Are you shot?
Do exactly what I say.
Exactly.
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
yes.
Please don't hurt me.
I'm here to help you.
I'm Reese.
Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38416.
Assigned to protect you.
you've been targeted for termination.
This is one-L-19.
Westbound on Olympic.
Approaching Overland.
This is a mistake.
I didn't do anything.
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.
This isn't true.
How could that man just get up after you...
It's not a man.
A machine.
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101 .
A machine?
Like a robot?
Not a robot.
A cyborg cybernetic organism.
No.
He was bleeding.
Just a second.
Get your head down.
Listen.
The Terminator's an infiltration unit.
Part man, part machine.
Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat chassis.
Microprocessor controlled.
Fully armoured, very tough.
Outside it's living human tissue.
Flesh, skin, hair, blood grown for the cyborgs.
Look, Reese, I don't know...
Pay attention.
I gotta ditch this car.
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.
But these are new.
They look human.
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.
I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him.
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.
Not yet.
Not for about forty years.
Are you saying it's from the future?
One possible future...
from your point of view.
I don't know tech stuff.
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?
Right.
Right.
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do.
Don't do that again.
Just let me go.
Listen and understand.
That Terminator is out there.
It can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with.
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.
Can you stop it?
I don't know.
With these weapons, I don't know.
All units.
Ford suspect vehicle has been found in a parking structure...
Reese, why me?
Why does it want me?
There was a nuclear war.
A few years from now, all this, this whole place, everything, it's gone, just gone.
There were survivors.
Here, there.
Nobody even knew who started it.
It was the machines, Sarah.
I don't understand.
Defence network computers.
New, powerful, hooked into everything, trusted to run it all.
They say it got smart a new order of intelligence.
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.
It decided our fate in a microsecond.
Extermination.
Did you see this war?
No.
I grew up after.
In the ruins.
Starving.
Hiding from the H-Ks.
H-Ks?
Hunter-killers.
Patrol machines built in automated factories.
Most of us were rounded up.
Put in camps for orderly disposal.
This was burned in by laser scanner.
Some of us were kept alive.
To work.
Loading bodies.
The disposal units ran night and day.
We were that close to going out for ever.
But there was one man who taught us to fight.
To storm the wire of the camps.
To smash those metal motherfuckers into junk.
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.
His name was Connor.
John Connor.
your son, Sarah.
your unborn son.
Drive.
Reese!
No, Reese.
No, no, no.
They'll kill you.
you in the Cadillac, let me see your hands now.
Get out of the car.
Drop to your knees.
Out of the car.
Drop to the ground.
Sarah.
Sarah, try to drink some of this.
Listen, are you sure it's them?
I mean, maybe I should look at the bodies.
No.
They've been identified and there's no doubt.
Ginger.
Kiddo.
Sarah, this is Dr Silberman.
Hi, Sarah.
Tell him everything Reese told you, Sarah.
Do you feel up to that?
yeah, I guess so.
you're a doctor?
Criminal psychologist.
Is Reese crazy?
That's what we're gonna find out.
So you're a soldier.
Fighting for whom?
With the 1 32nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.
That's the year 2027?
That's right.
Then I was assigned...
This is fucking great.
..under John Connor.
Who was the enemy?
A computer defence system...
Goddamn!
Sorry.
..built for SAC-NORAD by Cyberdyne Systems.
I see.
And this computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy.
Killing him, in effect, before he's even conceived.
A sort of retroactive abortion?
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.
He screwed it first...
Ed, shut up.
Why didn't the computer just kill Connor then?
Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator?
It had no choice.
Their defence grid was smashed.
We'd won.
Taking out Connor then would make no difference.
Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence.
Is that when you captured the lab complex and found...
What is it called?
The time displacement equipment?
That's right.
The Terminator had already gone through.
Connor sent me to intercept and they blew the whole place.
Well, how are you supposed to get back?
I can't.
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.
It's just him and me.
It's just him and me.
Why didn't you bring any weapons?
Something more advanced.
Don't you have ray guns?
Ray guns.
Show me a piece of future technology.
You go naked.
Something about the field generated by a living organism.
Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
OK, OK.
But this cyborg, ifit's metal...
?
Surrounded by living tissue.
Oh, right.
Great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.
See how clever it is?
It doesn't require a shred of proof.
Most paranoid delusions are intricate, but this is brilliant.
Why were the other women killed?
Records were lost in the war.
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.
Her full name, where she lived.
Theyjust knew the city.
The Terminator was just being systematic.
Let's go back...
Look, you have heard enough.
I have answered your questions.
I have to see Sarah Connor.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Then why am I talking to you?
Who is in authority here?
Please...
Shut up!
You still don't get it, do you?
He'll find her.
That's what he does.
That's all he does.
You can't stop him.
He'll reach down her throat and pull her fucking heart out!
Doc.
Let go ofme!
Sorry.
He's crazy?
In technical terminology, he's a loon.
Sarah, this is what they call body armour.
Our TAC guys wear these.
It'll stop a 1 2-gauge round.
This other man must've been wearing one under his coat.
Feel that.
He punched through the windshield.
He was probably on PCP.
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it.
There was this guy once...
you see this scar?
Thank you.
There's a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.
Be at least an hour before your mother gets here.
I can't sleep.
Try.
It may not look it, but that couch is very comfortable.
you'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here.
Could I see her?
No.
Can't see her.
She's making a statement.
Where is she?
It make take a while.
If you wanna wait, there's a bench over there.
I'll be back.
Stay here.
Watch him.
Ed...
Sarah!
Reese.
This way.
KFLB news time.
4.36.
Top story the largest single law enforcement mobilisation in California history is currently underway.
Police in five counties are engaged in a massive manhunt for...
Take this.
All right.
Let's get this off the road.
you cold?
Freezing.
Reese?
you got a first name?
Kyle.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
White light.
Pain.
It's like being born maybe.
My God.
I caught one back there.
you mean you got shot?
It's not bad.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
It's OK.
Forget it.
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy?
Take this off.
Jesus.
See?
It passed right through the meat.
This is gonna make me puke.
Would you just talk about something?
What?
I don't know.
Anything.
Just talk.
Tell me about my son.
He's about my height.
He has your eyes.
What's he like?
you trust him.
He's got a strength.
I'd die for John Connor.
Well, at least now I know what to name him.
Don't suppose you know who the father is so I won't tell him to get lost?
John never said much about him.
I know he dies before the war...
Wait.
I don't wanna know.
So was it John that sent you here?
I volunteered.
Why?
It was a chance to meet the legend.
Sarah Connor, who taught her son to fight, organise, prepare from when he was a kid.
When you were in hiding before the war.
you're talking about things I haven't done yet in the past tense.
It's driving me crazy.
Are you sure you have the right person?
I'm sure.
Come on!
Do I look like the mother of the future?
I mean, am I tough?
Organised?
I can't even balance my chequebook.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honour and I don't want it.
Any of it.
your son gave me a message to give to you.
Made me memorise it.
Thank you, Sarah, for your courage through the dark years.
I can't help you with what you must soon face.
The future is not set.
you must be stronger than you imagine you can be.
you must survive or I will never exist.
That's all.
It's a good field dressing.
you like it?
It's my first.
Get some sleep.
It'll be light soon.
OK.
Talk to me some more.
About what?
Tell me about where you're from.
All right.
you stay down by day, but at night you can move around.
you still have to be careful because the H-Ks use infrared.
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.
That's when the infiltrators started to appear.
The Terminators were the newest.
The worst.
Traversing your sector in search mode.
750 metres north ofyour position.
Let's go.
Reese.
DN384...
Right.
Let him in.
Terminator!
I was dreaming about dogs.
We use 'em to spot Terminators.
your world is pretty terrifying.
Hey, buddy, you got a dead cat in there or what?
Fuck you, asshole.
God damn.
Thank you.
Is this enough?
yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.
I'm coming.
We need a room.
With a kitchen.
Do you have one with a kitchen?
I am dying for a shower.
We should check your bandage, too.
Later.
I'm going out for supplies.
Keep this.
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.
I need to know where to reach you.
You tell me to hide out at the cabin and you won't tell me what's going on?
I am worried sick here.
OK.
OK, here's the number.
You ready?
yes.
Go ahead.
It's 408 555 1439.
Room nine.
Got it?
I've got it.
I gotta go.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more right now.
I love you, Mom.
I love you, too, sweetheart.
Tiki Motel.
Give me your address there.
What have we got?
Mothballs...
corn syrup...
ammonia.
What's for dinner?
Plastique.
That sounds good.
What is it?
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.
I learned to make it when I was a kid.
Make sure there's none on the threads.
Like this.
Screw the end cap on.
Very gently.
you must've had a fun childhood.
That's good.
All right.
Six more like that and I'll get started on the fuses.
He'll find us, won't he?
Probably.
It'll never be over, will it?
Look at me.
I'm shaking.
Some legend.
you must be pretty disappointed.
No, I'm not.
Kyle, the women in your time, what are they like?
Good fighters.
That's not what I meant.
Was there someone special?
Someone...?
A girl, you know.
No.
Never.
Never?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
So much pain.
Pain can be controlled.
you just disconnect it.
So you feel nothing?
John Connor gave me a picture of you once.
I didn't know why at the time.
It was very old, torn, faded.
you were young like you are now.
you seemed just a little sad.
I used to always wonder what you were thinking at that moment.
I memorised every line, every curve.
I came across time for you, Sarah.
I love you.
I always have.
I shouldn't have said that.
Think fast.
Trade places.
Faster.
Drive faster.
Kyle.
Oh, my God.
you stay here.
Let's get outta here.
Get out.
Kyle.
Come on.
Get up.
Come on.
Help me.
Get out.
Get out.
Don't stop.
Run.
Sarah.
Kyle.
We did it, Kyle.
We got him.
No.
Wait.
What are you doing?
Cover, so he can't track us.
Come on.
No.
Kyle.
Come on.
Come on.
Leave me here.
Move it, Reese.
On your feet, soldier.
On your feet.
Move it.
Get back.
Go back.
Run, Sarah.
No.
Run.
Run.
Come on, motherfucker.
No.
you're terminated, fucker.
Kyle.
Seven.
November 10.
Where was l?
What's difficult is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to.
But I guess I have a while before you're old enough to understand these tapes.
They're more for me at this point just so that I can get it straight.
Fill her up.
Should I tell you about your father?
Boy, that's a tough one.
Will it effect your decision to send him here, knowing that he is your father?
If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.
God, a person could go crazy thinking about this.
I suppose I will tell you.
I owe him that.
Maybe it'll help if...
you know that in the few hours that we had together, we loved a lifetime's worth.
What did he just say?
He says you're very beautiful.
He is ashamed to ask you for five dollars for this picture.
But if he doesn't, his father will beat him.
Pretty good hustle, kid.
What did he just say?
He said there's a storm coming in.
Son of a...
Damn!
Nice doggy, nice doggy!
Holy shnikees!
Late again Tommy?
You're pathetic.
Shut up, Richard!
Hurry up Tommy, hurry up!
Damn!
Hi.
How are you?
Oh, man!
No, please, God, no!
Son of a...
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Pard me.
Can I Just check this, uh.
D +?
Oh my God!
I passed!
I passed!
Oh, man i got a D+!
I'm gonna graduate!
I wish that we'd known each other.
This is a little awkward.
I'm gonna graduate!
D+!
Hey guys, do i look different now that i'm a college grad?
Not really.
Apparently they give a lot fewer D+'s than D-'s.
It's not a grade they like to give out, i'll tell ya that right now.
Yeah, you mentioned that.
So, that's it for school, uh?
Now what?
No idea.
Well, for now i'll probably go back and work in my dad's loading dock like always.
And after that, figure it out.
I'm gonna miss you man.
You're the best.
Uh-uh, you are the best.
I love all you guys.
Specially you.
I'm gonna make a toast.
To the best bunch of rugby freaks ever born.
Yes sir.
Maybe we weren't the smartest guys on campus.
Maybe we spent too much time puking off balconies.
But we had fun, huh?
Yeah!
Now, some of us are leaving, and that is sad.
But this isn't the end.
No way.
We're gonna show this world a thing or two.
We're gonna show...
Richard Hayden?
Tommy.
So where's my dad?
I thought he was gonna meet me at the airport.
He was at the airport this morning, but you weren't on the plane.
He said he had a surprise for me.
Maybe.
I guess you should have called.
I did call, earlier, when...
using the phone.
Earlier?
When was that?
Er...
later...
When, when...
then...
I...
huh.., I left a message.
A message?
What number did you call?
...
...
...
I can't hear you.
You're trailing off.
And did i catch a "niner" in there?
What Were you calling from, a walkie-talkie?
No, it was cordless.
You know what?
Don't.
Not here, not now.
Did you hear i finally graduated?
Yeah.
And just a shade under a decade too.
All right.
You know, a lot of people go to college for years.
I know.
They're called doctors.
Oh, that has to be you.
Spray that thing for bugs?
Hey, what happened to the tire plant?
They shut it down last month.
Would you mind not eating in the car?
It's kind of a rule.
You still got your GTX car, huh?
Yes.
And i dropped in a Magnum with a six-pack.
You hang on to a car this cherry, kinda'like your suitcase.
Kinda'like your suitcase...
Hey, what's new with the old gang from high-school?
I don't know Tommy.
I didn't really like the old gang from high-school.
Hey, the muffler plant's gone too.
Yes.
Come on!
Dammit.
That sounds good.
Melted chocolate inside the dash.
That really ups the resale value.
I think you're gonna be ok here.
They have a thin candy shell.
'Surprised you didn't know that.
I think your brain is a thick candy shell.
Your brain has the shell on it.
Are you talking?
Shut up, Richard!
Ron, don't tell me the bank thinks we need to wait it out.
Any business that tries to wait it out will be just that, out.
In auto-parts, you're either growing our you're dying.
There ain't no third direction.
Tom, you're talking about a huge loan.
Maybe instead of borrowing, you should take on a partner.
This always has and always will be a family firm.
My grandfather founded it in ' my father kept it running during the depression, my aunt Ilenne, ran it when he went away to war and someday my son will run it.
Hi dad.
Tommy!
Am i proud of you.
Mister big time, college grad, huh?
Thanks dad.
You're looking great kid.
Thanks Mr Rittenhauer.
Oh, how you doin'Mr Reilly?
Real good.
I had a kidney removed last April, but i still have the other one.
You remember Mr Gilmore from the bank?
Yeah.
Nice to see you again sir.
How are you?
Listen, why don't you come out on the floor with us?
Mr Gilmore needs reminding of why he does business with us.
Richard, could you huh...
Run these figures by accounting.
No problem.
My fellow nerds and I will retire to the nerdery with our calculators.
We should have something for you...
by this afternoon.
Hard hats, gentlemen.
If you get hit in the head without wearing one of these, they scoop your brains up with a goddamned soup ladle.
Hey, look alive!
Low bridge!
Son of a...
You all right, Tommy?
Yeah...
What happened?
Nothing.
Danny!
How's that new son-in-law?
He's a real pain in the butt.
Hey Tommy, you're back!
Way to go on that D +!
Thanks, Danny.
Looking good man.
Hey, Tommy!
Hey man!
How you doing?
Hey how are you.
Good to see ya, how you doin'?
Hey, Sammy!
Tommy!
Welcome home buddy.
Hang in there, Ron.
We're almost there.
Lou, i got some papers i want you to sign in the office.
Hey, Tommy!
What are you doing on the floor?
Yeah, I was going crazy on the loading docks, so your dad moved me in here.
Hey, what is this thing?
It's a buffer.
I take oil filters that need smoothing and give 'em a quick zap.
Cool!
Can i try one?
Help yourself.
Nice distance.
Tommy!
Come on!
Let's go!
Yes, sir.
See ya.
Here she is, Ron.
My dream.
This, my friend, is our new brake pad division.
And the future of "Callahan Auto".
Quite a sight, Tom.
This is awesome.
You say these brake pads are gonna revolutionize the industry?
Composed of high grade steel and graphite.
They're the goddamned Rolls Royce of brake pads.
That's what they are.
I get tears off my eyes just thinking about it.
You coming awful fast, how do you do it?
I need fresh capital for material, for new work force before i can turn these machines on.
Look out!
I got catlike speed and reflexes.
In years, have i ever said no to you, huh?
Why say "no" when it feels so good to say "yes"?
I was checking the, ah, specs on the end line, for the rotary girder...
I'm retarded...
Okay, Tom.
Let's go!
Yes, sir.
Okay, left.
Can i open my eyes now dad?
I never told you you had to close them in the first place, son.
Yeah, go ahead!
Open 'em up.
That's my name!
Yeah, and that's your new office now, college grad.
Go on in there!
Awesome!
Hey, there's even a fridge!
This is great...
you can put six-packs of be- Soda in here.
Milk, yoghurt.
You can put candy bars in the freezer.
Anything that you wanna keep cool.
Mr Callahan, i need your John Hancock on these reports.
John Hancock...
It's Herbie Hancock.
Richard, check out my new office!
You've a window.
And why shouldn't you?
You've been here minutes.
Now look son, these are our new catalogues.
Get to know them, they're important.
Richard, you promise me you're gonna look after Tommy here 'til he gets his feet wet.
Sure.
And thanks for choosing me.
Now don't forget, we're going home early today.
I got another surprise for you.
Cool!
Thanks, dad.
It's called reading.
Top to bottom, left to right.
Group words together as a sentence.
Take Tylenol for any headaches.
Midol for any cramps.
Shut up!
Can i open my eyes now dad?
For God's sake son, will you quit covering your damned eyes?
Holy shnikees!
Is that for me?
No, son, that's for me.
Dad, she's like a ten.
Hi, honey.
This must be Tommy.
Are you Tommy?
I'm Tommy.
I'm Beverly, and you're just adorable.
Nah...
Son, i got an announcement to make.
Tom, i've asked Beverly to be my wife.
Wow, man!
What did she say?
It's so cool that you're getting married Saturday.
So where did you guys meet?
Here you go, sweetie.
We met at the fat farm spa resort thing.
Beverly was one of the trainers.
In fact she was the only one of the trainers i didn't wanna plant six feet under a lettuce patch.
Wait 'til you hear this!
She's got a son.
He worked at the spa too.
I met him.
He's a terrific guy.
You're really gonna like him.
He's coming here today, for the wedding.
Tommy, it sounds funny saying this, but my son is going to be your new brother.
Brother?
I'm gonna have a brother?
I've always dreamed about having a brother.
Speak of the devil.
A brother!
Brother?
I'm Paul, you must be Tommy.
Brothers don't shake hands.
Brothers gotta hug.
I can't believe i have a whole new family.
This is awesome!
Yeah.
Great.
No offense, but if i showed a picture of your mom to some of my buddies at school she'd definitely be boner of the month.
I'm honoured.
So is there anything to do in this town besides eat?
Tons of stuff.
Late night pitch and putt.
We go to the livestock auction and cruise the -H babes.
Throw stuff off the bridge.
What do you feel like doing?
I don't know.
Something a little more dangerous.
Sure.
All you can handle bro.
Look at 'em there!
Pretty maids all in a row.
I want the one on the left.
She's perfect.
Which one d'you want?
Does it make a difference?
Oh, yeah.
Wait a second.
Is this your first time?
Yeah, Tommy, it is.
You're gonna remember this the rest of your life.
Can't believe you've never been cow tipping before.
Get ready to live!
She's sleeping.
What you do is put your shoulder into her and you push.
And?
They fall over.
And this doesn't strike you as kinda'dumb?
We're family.
We're gonna be doing lots of dumb stuff together.
Wait 'til Christmas.
You keep your feet shoulder-width apart.
Stay between the udder and the hock, it's a...
belly option on .
Ready!
Hut!
Holy Shnikees!
Hey, get off my property!
Run for it!
I'll save you brother!
I'm ok.
Get away from me!
Get up!
Come on!
I love you.
Hey, get me!
My turn!
Over here!
These shoes are Italian.
They're worth more than your life.
Man!
Did i get dooshed with mud!
Hey Chucko, that doesn't smell like mud.
Oh, man, that's cold!
I'm a maniac.
Maniac...
...
on the floor.
And i'm dancing like i never danced before.
Did you eat a lot of paint chips when you were a kid?
Why?
Mornin', Richard.
Hi.
Luke, I am your father.
I've interrupted "happy time".
Look, your father wants you to check out the delay problems we're having at the loading dock.
Now, i know you'd love to just sit there and keep being...
not slim, but we gotta work a little today, okay.
That was from Star Wars".
I know.
R.T.
I think i figured out the problem.
This order's going to Columbus.
That's a one day delivery, but you've got it marked down for two.
That's because it's going to Columbus, Georgia, not Columbus, Ohio.
You see these letters by the city?
That's called a state.
What else you got, Wonder Boy?
That's pretty much it for now.
Tommy, maybe you should go back to college for another years and study a globe.
Tommy Callahan?
Michelle Brock.
Chaparrall High.
Remember?
Yeah, i remember!
I sat next to you in History.
You work here?
It's so bizarre that you work here.
Come on in!
Oh, and forget about R.T.!
He's pissed off 'cause he recently found out what a loser he is.
A loser he is!
Nice.
How come you don't put the files in the file cabinets?
I don't like file cabinets.
Why not?
You have to open them.
I've got my own system.
Hasn't failed me yet.
All the shipping orders go through me, which means i spend about half of my pathetically anal life in here.
So if i couldn't do things my own way, i'd probably freak out and blow up the whole town.
Cool!
Hey, remember your brother, Duane?
Whatever happened to him?
We used to go to "Safeway" all the time and get caught trying to steal doughnuts.
He's a cop.
He had to get a real job when my parents moved to Cuyahoga Falls.
Want one?
I'd better not.
I have what doctors call a little bit of a weight problem.
I used to grab bear claws as a kid, two at a time and i'd get 'em lodged right in this region here.
How about some coffee?
I'd love some.
Man, i bet half the town's here.
Yeah...
You look great dad.
You look good too, Tommy Boy.
Listen, this marriage thing, i know it's a big step...
but you know...
Ever since your mom died...
Something about getting old and being alone.
You know...
it's something...
Dad...
It's cool, you know.
I just want you to be happy.
Yeah, i know you do.
And i am, kid!
I am, Tommy boy.
They're ready for you sir.
Good.
We're ready too.
How do we look?
Chubby?
I think that's the champagne talking.
And so these vows are held sacred from now until eternity.
If there's any person who finds a reason these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace.
You kiddin'?
Go get her, Tom!
Now by the power invested in me by the state of Ohio, i now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Say something for the bride and groom!
Hey dad and Beverly, this is Michelle Brock, the prettiest gal in Sandusky.
Michelle, say a little something into the camera!
A little something into the camera.
Sounds good, Tom, but i'd like to take a look at your operation before i commit.
Fair enough, Doug.
'Course i can get a hell of a good look at a t-bone steak by sticking my head up a bulls ass, but i'd rather take a butcher's word for it.
Bull's ass, that's great.
And you guarantee everything you sell?
You know i could guarantee you all day long, but we both know a guarantee is only as good as the man who writes it.
Sounds good, Tom.
I'll send the contract next week.
Good man!
You're still the best, Tom.
Eight whisky-sours and i still sell the son of a bitch.
Damn i'm good.
I just wanna tell you you really look dynamite today, Beverly.
Yeah, Tom, you're a lucky man.
Boy, would I like to get some of that!
Good Lord!
Oh no!
Listen, Richard, you got a edit button on that thing?
It'll cost ya.
Come here, you little prick!
All right, all right, hold it a second folks!
Wait a minute...
Yeah, yeah, workin'.
Listen, i wanna thank you all for coming today to welcome two new Callahans to the family.
My beautiful wife, Beverly and my new son, Paul.
I feel like i'm the luckiest man in the world today.
Hit it!
And right now i'm gonna need you, Tommy boy, to get this place going.
Oh, for me dad?
Yeah, you Tommy boy.
Dad, i really don't think...
Okay.
First rocker, take it, Tommy boy!
That's right, Tommy boy!
Shake the rock to me!
That's right, dad!
Dad?
Somebody call!
There's not much more we can say, really.
We've lost someone we love, and it hurts.
Even though Tom is gone, he'll remain in our lives for ever.
comforting us, making us laugh...
and marching over us.
My dad gave me this boat.
We'd come out here late at night, when there's no one else in the lake and then he'd be over there, on the shore, and he'd yell: "Quit playing with your dingie!" I'm gonna really miss him.
Your father was a great guy.
Yeah.
I'm really glad you brought me out here.
Can't believe you wanted to.
Although it's pretty fun.
If we had some wind...
I can't believe there's no wind.
You need wind...
cause it, uh- Helps push the sail.
Yeah.
So, what are you gonna do now?
I don't know.
But, i gotta do something.
I don't know what.
Man, do i sound like an idiot?
No.
Sorry about this wind.
I can't believe there isn't any wind out here.
This is ridiculous.
No, it's great.
It's very peaceful.
Hey tub-o!
You ain't moving!
Yeah, need a little wind here!
No.
You need to drop a couple pounds, blimp!
Rascals.
I guess that's your theory.
So, we'll see what happens tomorrow.
Hey, your sail is limp, like your dick!
Watch your language in front of the lady, punk!
Geez!
You were saying?
Hey, Gilligan, did you eat the Skipper?
You kids better pray to the god of skinny punks that this wind doesn't pick up, cause i'll come over there and shove an oar up your ass!
Eapers creepers, those guys keep interrupting us.
I'm sorry about that.
You were saying about the uh...
Hey lady, look out!
There's a fat whale on your boat!
Yeah.
Free Willy!
Listen up you little spazoids, i know where you live and i've seen where you sleep.
I swear to everything holy that your mothers will cry when they see what i've done to you!
I was just kidding.
I've no idea where they live.
That was awesome!
Ladies and gentlemen, we're in real trouble.
Zalinsky Industries has an offer on the table to buy us out.
But as you realize "Callahan" has been family owned since Tommy's great grandfather laid the first brick And i'll be damned if that's gonna change on my watch.
Frank, if we sell while our value's still high, everyone who owns stock in this company stands to make a lot of money.
That of course includes you, Mrs Callahan, Now that you and Tommy are the primary shareholders.
It seems vulgar to think about money at a time like this.
I don't wanna hear the word "sell" again.
But Ron, we do need that loan to keep us afloat until we figure things out.
I'm sorry, Frank, we can't do it.
Tom got in way over his head when he built the new brake pad division.
The bank just can't take any chance in putting up any more money.
Now, let's face it, when big Tom died, "Callahan Auto" may have died with him.
If this factory goes under, the whole town goes under.
And that's when the whores come in.
Excuse me, what was that?
Men laying their trick-money down.
dollars to pay the rent?
Maybe instead i'll spend it on the whore.
Frank, i really don't think we have any choice.
Maybe i can help.
I give you everything i've got: my house, the stock.
If i give you that stuff, it's collateral, then would you give us that loan?
Yes, i suppose so.
Wait a second!
What are you saying, Tommy?
You just wanna hand over your inheritance?
Right.
If it'll help get the brake pads going.
My dad said the new pads were the future of "Callahan".
But who's going to sell them?
I will.
I'll go on my dad's sale trip.
I'll be damned!
Whores running around doing their little behind shake for the men folk.
I kinda like her idea.
For Christ's sake, once during the war i visited a prostitute, and my life has been a living hell eversince.
Hold on a minute!
Do we really wanna put the future of the company in Tommy's hands?
We're running low on options here, Ted.
I can hold out Zalinsky for a couple of weeks.
What have we got to lose?
How about the jobs of people?
No offense, Tommy, but you don't know the first thing about brake pads.
Hey, i know i'm not probably the answer you guys are looking for, but i feel i gotta do something.
You're right.
I don't know much about this stuff, but he does.
Oh, no!
That's right.
Richard knows more about brake pads than anyone in here.
And since you were my dad's right-hand man, i see you have the rest of the year pretty much wide open.
Time out!
Bad idea.
I don't think anyone could help Baby Huey out there on the road.
You have a better suggestion?
I can actually hear you're getting fatter.
What did i say about eating in the car, anyways?
That it's not good cause it spoils your dinner?
Hey, Tommy, this is not a vacation for me.
And i'm here against my will, so the least you can do is pretend to work.
Ok?
Now let's review!
Okay, you're right.
Review time.
Let's do it up!
Feed me!
First, what are the three grades of Callahan Brake pads?
Personal, commercial and...
agricultural.
And what is our carrying charge for all the merchandise in the warehouse?
One and a...
Half per cent!
I knew that!
Why can't i remember it?
Try an association, like, uh: Let's say the average person uses % of their brain.
How much do you use?
%.
The rest is clogged with malted hops and bong resin.
I gotta do this!
This's got to be the one!
I gotta do this.
It's gotta be me...
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Sorry, i'm ready.
Hey, does this suit make me look fat?
No, your face does.
Okay, let's check you out!
All right.
That's a clip-on.
Are you sure?
Alright now, it's sales time, remember we don't take no- No shit from anyone.
No.
We don't take no prisoners.
We don't take no for an answer.
Oh yeah.
We don't take no for an answer...
No.
Okey dokey.
No.
Gotcha.
Thanks.
Terrific!
Thanks for your time.
Let me say...
maybe.
Well then, i'd just like to add that the spectrometer read-out on the nickel-cadmium alloy mix indicates a good, rich strobe n'fade, decreasing incidence of wear to the pressure plate.
If you could just...
Whoa, little fella, you're not speaking my language.
What my associate is trying to say, is that our new brake pads are really cool.
You're not even gonna believe it.
Like, let's say you're driving along the road, with your family...
And you're driving along...
And then all of a sudden there's a truck tire in the middle of the road, and you hit the brakes.
Woah, that was close.
Now let's see what happens when you're driving with "the other guy's brake pads".
You're driving along, you're driving along, and suddenly your kids are yelling from the back seat.
"I gotta go to the bathroom, daddy!" "Not now, dammit!" Truck tire!
I can't stop!
There's a cliff!
And your family screaming: "Oh my God, we're burning alive!" No, i can't feel my leg!
Here comes the meat-wagon.
And the medic gets out and says: "Oh, my God!" New guy's in the corner, puking his guts out.
All because you wanna save a couple of extra pennies...
and to me, it doesn't- Get out!
Now!
Yes, sir.
Do you validate?
Now!
She's a quart low.
Oh, yeah?
Then guess what, open it back up and put it in!
That's your penance for your puppet show back there.
And while you're at it, fill it up with gas, okay?
I'm gonna ask directions to the next huge embarrassing failure.
You're a huge embarrassing failure.
What?
Nuthin'.
Hey chief, could you tell me how far it is to Davenport?
mi.
I can't find it on this map.
Well, get yourself a new map.
Son of a...
Well, it's gotta be on the map, Davenport, because you say it's mi away.
And you're really smart...
Yet it's not on the map.
I'm picking up your sarcasm.
I'd hope so...
'cause i'm laying it on you pretty thick.
That's a map of Illinois, which we're in.
On the border of Iowa.
Which is where Davenport is, mi away.
You're in the wrong state.
Get yourself a new map!
That wasn't so hard, was it?
How much do i owe your for gas?
You didn't pump any.
What?!
Why didn't you pump any gas?
They're all out.
They only got diesel.
Better go to the next station!
What'd you do?
I'd just like to welcome you all to our annual Callahan Employee Night.
I know it doesn't quite feel the same without Big Tom here, but we're still a family.
So let's try and have some fun!
Hey, Mr Rittenhauer!
Is it true Tommy's on the road trying to save this place?
Tommy's out there filling in for his dad until we get things settled here.
Are you kidding?
We're all screwed!
That kid's one apple that fell way off the tree.
Mommy, i want a popsicle.
That hurt!
You wanna act like a baby, i'll treat you like one.
Now, if you wanna act like a big boy...
Bad mommy.
Don't call me that, it's creepy.
Come on, this is working out better than we planned.
I thought it'd take a year to bleed him dry in the divorce settlement.
Instead the guy croaks, you own half the company.
Yeah, it's too bad he didn't leave me any cash.
You talked to the banker?
Yeah.
Unfortunately your stock isn't worth dick until they sell the place.
That moment is rapidly approaching.
Hi, grandpa.
Mr Rittenhauer, is Tommy, you know, doing okay?
Yeah, sometimes it takes a little time for a salesman to find his style.
You think he's finding one?
I hope so.
Hold on right there honey.
I'll see you Michelle.
See you.
I'm telling you, Paul...
the only thing keeping us poor is Tommy.
The guy's an idiot.
He won't sell squat.
This is what i think of Callahan.
Tommy saved the factory.
That's a laugh!
I don't see any McKeesport.
It's the next town, Tons-of-Fun.
It's gotta be there.
Ok, where's moron?
Moron's here, so McKeesport...
Look, Magellan, we're at this wrinkle here.
You saw it happen.
There was nothing i could do, right?
Maybe if you didn't lean over to insult me you would have seen it coming.
Shut up, Tommy!
It's not my fault.
Poor little furry thing!
I'd never seen one close up before.
What are we gonna do?
We can't just leave it here.
Oh, no!
Loading it up took us over an hour.
Now we only got minutes before "Brady Automotive" closes.
Yeah, where are we gonna take the deer?
I don't know.
The vet?
You take dead animals to the vet?
Why not?
I'd take you to the vet.
Yeah, i'll take you to the...
Got that?
Shut up!
It's just down the hall sir, last door on the left.
Thank you.
Hey, what's your hurry?
You know that thing in the back seat?
It's not an air refreshener.
It's a dead rotting deer carcass.
And we gotta take care of it quick.
And this is one of our oldest customers, we should be in and out.
This sales thing isn't so easy.
You can't just go in and out, you gotta finesse'm a little bit.
Hey, by finesse do you mean sputtering sentence fragments and lighting things on fire?
No, but...
It's nice to see you again Mr Insult.
Say, have you seen Richard anywhere?
Cause if you do, can you ask him, i mean, since he's so good, if he might wanna try selling?
Oh yeah?
Watch and learn.
Of course i understand what "no" means.
But if i took no for an answer i probably would wind up on a street corner selling spicy hotdogs and wearing a funny hat, right?
It makes sense, doesn't it?
Look, i've been doing business with Callahan since i hung up my shingle.
But i don't like you.
Probably never will.
You're a smug unhappy little man, and you treat people like they were idiots.
Mr Brady, you and my dad go way back.
Son, i was sorry to hear about your dad, i was.
But before i decide to keep my business with your place, i'd have to come by and have a look at your new operation.
Hey, i'll tell you what: you can take a good look at a butcher's ass by sticking your head up there but wouldn't you rather take his word for it?
What?
I'm failing to make the connection here, son.
No, i mean, you can get a good look at a T-bone by sticking your head up a butcher's ass, but then...
No, it's gotta be your bull.
Here's the deal, if i want you-- You have derailed.
Shut up, Richard!
Boy, i'm really at a loss for words here.
Forget it.
I quit.
I can't do this anymore man.
My head's about to explode.
My whole life sucks.
I don't know what i'm doing.
I don't know where i'm going.
My dad just died.
We just killed Bambi.
I'm out here getting my ass kicked, and every time i drive down the road, i want to jerk the wheel into a goddamn bridge embankment!
We'll be in touch.
That guy might not call us.
I can't believe you called me a psycho.
Were you in there just now?
You are a psycho.
Good God!
And comb your hair.
I wouldn't say you did much better.
I thought you were so cool.
Watch and learn he says.
And i was watching.
You know what i saw?
It's alive!
I think it tried to bite me!
No way that just happened.
My car is completely destroyed.
I swear i've seen a lot of stuff in my life, but that was awesome!
But sorry about your car, man.
It sucks.
We'll return to the "Zalinsky Family Theater" after these messages.
Will you shut the window, Tommy!
You're letting moths in.
No, it's hot in here.
Will you please...
Look, it's him!
America, if you need starters, spark plugs, ball joints, gaskets, camshafts, u-joints or rocker-arms, anything that can be screwed or glued to that car or truck of yours?
Come see ol'Ray!
You want a guarantee?
I got a guarantee stamped on every box.
He's got really weird hair.
But more important is the guarantee that i make to the American worker.
I want your truck to help you get the job done.
I want your cruiser to get out there safely, so you can clean up the streets.
And i want your kids to be safe when you take them for a ride.
Thanks, Ray.
Thank you, son.
The name's Zalinsky.
I make car parts for the American working man, because that's who i am.
And that's who i care about.
Drive down to Zalinsky.
He's the auto parts king.
He seems like a nice guy.
This is the guy trying to buy the company, not to mention put you on the street and all you can say is "he seems like a nice guy"?
He does.
Michelle!
I'm glad you called me back.
Yeah, things are going great.
I feel my first sale coming out real soon.
Yeah, he's here.
He's just going over his car insurance forms.
Could we get any more moths in here?
What?
Oh, Richard's vacuuming.
He's vacuuming.
I don't know.
I guess he's clean.
Can i call you back in a few minutes?
Thanks.
I miss you.
Hey!
You can't sleep with the window open.
And let me lay down some other rules too.
What are you so mad about?
Are you nuts?
Do you even have to ask?
My car is destroyed.
We haven't made one sale.
Which means we only have to sell about a half million brake pads in the next ten days, or else the factory is going under.
And the one guy who should be caring about this, you, doesn't.
You know what, Richard?
You don't know me as good as you think you do.
I care about stuff, i'm getting better at this sales thing.
I'm not, but i could if you help me.
Forget it, i have enough to do without having to change your diapers.
Richard, is this your coat?
Don't do it!
Fat guy in little coat.
No.
Fat guy in a little coat.
Take it off.
I'm serious.
Richard, what's happening?
Good tune man.
I don't think so.
Yeah, here we go.
This song sucks.
Talk about lame.
Totally.
You can change it if you want.
I don't care, it's up to you.
I can live with it if you can.
Suit yourself.
Oh, God.
Hey, i was just thinking, when we stopped for gas this morning i think it was you who put the oil in.
Hey, if you're gonna say i didn't put the right kind, then you're wrong.
I used W .
And besides, motor oil would have nothing to do with this accident.
True.
But you can't latch the hood too well if you don't take the can out you no-selling waste of space!
I swear to God you're worthless.
I'm sorry about your car.
But don't call me worthless.
I'm trying my best.
I'm not my dad.
That's right.
You're not your dad.
He could sell a ketchup popsicle to a woman in white gloves.
Ketchup popsicle?
Yeah.
I learned everything i know from him.
I didn't have a father, and he looked out for me.
But you!
He was your real dad and you just took it for granted.
Hey, i'm big Tom's son, he'll fix everything, so i'm allowed to be a moron.
That's it!
Get out of the car!
It's go time, you and me.
Look Mommy, the rhino is getting too close to the car.
Him too 'fraid to get out.
He just a little guy.
That's it big boy.
I'm gonna wail on you.
You're gonna regret volunteering for this job, Porky.
Hey boys and girls, it's Papa Smurf!
You know what, you don't want none of me, think it through.
Come on, give me your best shot, and i'll give you a free one!
Let me have it!
That's it?
Come on, you can do better than that, can't ya Captain Limp Wrist?
Try again.
Hey everybody, is there a window open?
I feel a draft.
If i wanted a kiss, i woulda called your mother.
That was a good one.
Prehistoric Forest...
Richard, do i have a mark on my face?
It really hurts.
No, nothing.
I thought i hit you on the shoulder.
My shoulder doesn't hurt very much, but my face does.
Right here.
Not here, or here so much, but right here.
Nope.
Sheep shape.
Waitress could i get that shrimp cocktail i saw on the glass case?
Yeah.
And you...
What can i get- Jesus, what happened to your face?
I knew it.
See, Richard?
I'll have chicken wings.
Kitchen's closed until dinner.
I just got cold stuff and desserts.
Boy, some chicken wings would really hit the spot.
You sure it's closed?
Let me check.
Yup, it's closed.
Okay.
I'll just have a sugar packet or two.
Hey, what's your name?
Helen.
That's nice.
You look like a Helen.
Helen, we're both in sales.
Let me tell you why i suck as a salesman.
Let's say i go into some guy's office let's say he's even remotely interested in buying something.
Well, then i get all excited, i'm like Jo-Jo, the idiot circus-boy, with a pretty new pet.
The pet is my possible sale.
Oh, my pretty little pet.
I love you!
So i stroke it, and i pet it, and i massage it.
I love it, i love my little naughty pet.
You're naughty.
And then i take my naughty pet, and i go...
I killed it!
I killed my sale!
That's when i blow it.
That's when people like us have got to forge head, Helen.
Am i right?
God, you're sick.
Tell you what, i'll go turn the friers back on and throw some wings in for ya.
Thanks, Helen.
Tommy like-y.
Tommy want wing-y.
Did that board to the head knock something loose?
What are you talking about?
That you just pulled at the waitress.
Why can't you sell like that?
I'm just having fun.
If we didn't get the wings, so what?
We still got that meat-lovers' pizza in the trunk.
You got the wings cause you're relaxed.
You had confidence.
And that's what it takes to sell.
Confidence.
Your dad had that.
Why do you always have to de-turd this things?
My dad was smart, i'm not.
Very true.
But there's two types of smarts, book smarts, which waved bye-bye to you long ago, and there's street-smarts, the ability to read people.
And you know how to do that, just like your dad.
He was the best at knowing what people wanted to hear, and what people needed to hear.
That's what selling is all about.
In a way, these people are buying you, not just brake pads.
Hey everybody, it's Tony Robbins!
Maybe you're right, Richard.
I think i am.
Holy Lord, look at this guy, caught him right after thanksgiving feast.
Nice, Richard.
Now i need a Pooper-Scooper.
I like your line.
And i like your prices.
But there's a problem.
There's no guarantee on the box.
If they break down, you can call me at home, even if i'm watching TV.
Callahan has guaranteed every part sold since .
Maybe so, but it's not on the box.
It should always be on the box.
Comforting you, calling out "I'm good.
I'll never let you down." "But if i do, i'm gonna make all things better." Our brake pads are made of a non-corrosive poly-plated...
Son, if you're not talking about a guarantee, skip it.
My customers need to see that little label, lookin'at 'em right in the eye.
Hey, you can get a good look at your butcher...
No.
What?
Remember, chicken wings.
Chicken wings?
Alright, uh, you wanna talk about guarantees, then...
Fellas, you just ran out of time.
Chicken wings.
Let's think about this for a sec, Ted.
Why would someone put a guarantee on a box?
Hmm, very interesting.
Go on!
I'm listening.
Here's the way i see it, Ted.
A guy puts a fancy guarantee on the box 'cause he wants you to feel all warm and toasty inside.
Yeah, makes a man feel good.
Of course it does.
Why shouldn't it?
You figure you put that little box under your pillow at night, the Guarantee Fairy might come down and leave a quarter, am i right, Ted?
What's your point?
The point is, how do you know the fairy isn't a crazy glue sniffer?
"Building model airplanes" says the little fairy.
Well, we're not buying it.
He sneaks into your house once, that's all it takes.
Next thing you know there's money missing off the dresser and your daughter is knocked up.
I've seen it a hundred times.
But why do they put a guarantee on the box then?
'Cause they know all they sold you was a guaranteed piece of shit.
That's all it is, isn't it?
Hey, if you want me to take a dump in a box and mark it "guaranteed", i will.
I got spare time.
But for now, for your customers'sake, for your daughter's sake you might wanna think about buying a quality product from me.
Okay, i'll buy from you.
Well I...
What?!
He's made one deal, Paul.
It's not the end of the world.
What would be good for us?
We wanna sell the factory.
They're not gonna sell the factory as long as Tommy keeps making sales.
Why don't you come to bed?
I got it!
What does every factory need?
Trucks.
They make stuff.
They gotta ship it.
It's most simple.
We stop the trucks, we stop Tommy boy.
Not good.
Come on man, let's at least take five minutes to celebrate our first victory!
Look, we got lucky, don't jinx it.
We only have a week left before the loan's due.
I gotta finish figuring out our trips tonight, so we can jam out early.
Okay, i'll tell you what.
You work out that scientific stuff, i'll go out and get a pizza.
The only thing i need to figure out is whether to get Chicago style or thin crust.
The salesman has left the building.
Chill bud.
Oh, mamasita!
Hi.
Tommy, scram!
Don't give her the weight room thing!
Do you know where the weight room is?
I'll check it out.
Sorry.
Oh, daddy likes!
You get wet honey, you deserve a swim...
Now take off that itchy robe.
Nobody's around.
It's naughty time.
Oh, for the love of God, i've been patient.
Please, don't stop!
You've been on the- Oh, those are real!
No one's looking.
Speaking of "no one's looking"...
Bad girl.
Ah, thank you...
I'm back.
Richard, what were you doing?
Going over some documents.
Where are they?
Geez, i don't see them.
They're in my briefcase.
I thought you were getting pizza.
They were closed.
How could you be reading documents when they're in your briefcase?
That's a mystery.
Were you watching "Spank-tro-Vision"?
Ok then, let's hit it!
Maybe you were watching a movie with that funny comedian, oh, what's his name?
Buddy Wackett?
All right then, let's get some shut eye!
Hey, that's a pretty girl down there.
Good for her!
Geez, i wonder if she goes out with one of the "Yankees".
Couldn't tell ya.
Big day tomorrow.
I hope we can keep this momentum going.
Yup, that'd be good.
Richard?
Who's your favorite little rascal?
Alfalfa or is it Spanky?
Sinner!
Yes, i'll buy.
Yes, i like what i hear.
Yes, sounds good.
By the way, did you ever eat paint chips as a kid?
Son of a...
A thousand units to Oshkosh?
Tommy, that's fabulous!
Your dad never sold a thousand in Oshkosh.
uh uh, since i've been here.
Lord, i never had to tinkle so bad in all my life.
Richard!
You're a riot!
Stop the car!
Son of a...
What the hell's gotten into you?
My thing got stuck in the zipper, i got piss all over my pants.
Ok, thanks.
Bye, i owe you.
Oh, there you are.
While i was waiting i thought i'd make a couple calls.
Okay, mom, i'll call you later then, bye bye.
What do you want?
I just wanted to tell you that Tommy's been talking a lot about you recently and well, thought you might wanna know that.
God, he's so sweet.
You've no idea how much it means having you and your mom as family.
He says the sweetest things about her.
Everything he does is sweet.
So, when does sweetie get back?
This Friday.
Which is great, because we're backed up on orders as it is.
He's turned into this...
selling machine.
Well, between that and the sweetness, i'd say hang on to it.
I gotta go.
Yes, sir.
I can have that for you tomorrow.
Well, that'd be great.
Thank you sir.
Housekeeping.
No, thank you.
Sleeping.
Housekeeping.
Could you come back here in an hour?
Housekeeping.
You want towel?
No towels, need sleepy.
Housekeeping.
You want mint for pillow?
Please, go away!
Let me sleep, for the love of God!
Housekeeping.
You want me jerk you off?
What kind of hotel is this.
what the hell areOh, it's you.
Good morning, sunshine.
Hey, guess what, i just called "Auto Tech" and they decided to make an order.
So according to my calculations, that puts us over the mark.
We did it?
We did.
Oh, Richard, i'm so happy!
Hold me!
Don't run away from your feelings!
Something went haywire down at shipping and receiving.
Your shipments got screwed up in the computer, the wrong parts went to the wrong cities.
Now all hell's broken lose.
I don't believe this.
Ok, so we call everyone and explain what happened.
Half the orders have already been cancelled.
What?!
They think it's an indication of how things work around here.
The real problem is that we won't be able to make the payment to the bank.
It's like a bad "Twilight Zone".
I think i'm growing a tumor.
Look, we talk to the bank.
Maybe they'll give us a break.
We've been doing business with them for years.
Tommy, it's all over.
You made a valiant effort, but we're gonna have to sell to Zalinsky.
I'm flying to Chicago to sign over the company.
What's gonna happen to the factory?
He's gonna shut it down.
Zalinsky doesn't care about our workers.
He wants the Callahan name, that's all.
Did anyone see "Scanners"?
Bottom line is, by pm tomorrow we'll all be unemployed.
Don't say anything, ok!
I know i've ruined your entire life, and you hate me, so let me pack my things and go crawling through a dark hole for a few years.
Hi.
So, do you hate me?
I just don't get it.
I guaranteed overnight delivery.
We faxed to our shipping addresses, didn't we?
Yes.
And they were right when i put them into my computer.
I swear.
And how could- Oh, man!
This was so big!
I know it was big, but it wasn't my fault.
Why can't you put your files in the file cabinet like everybody else, uh?
I mean, maybe if you weren't such a rebel, you could've avoided...
Don't worry because i've quit.
So you won't have to put up with anything anymore.
Michelle, wait!
Come on, please!
Thanks.
Have a good flight.
May i help you?
Hi, i called about a ticket to Cuyahoga Falls, the name's Brock.
Right.
That flight goes through Columbus.
Let me just call that up for you.
Excuse me.
Hello, is detective Duane Brock on duty today?
This town doesn't even know what's about to hit it.
Fish in a barrel, my man.
Town's the fish, people are the barrel.
Fish in a barrel...
What's wrong with you, Richard?
You can't drink in a car.
Don't you know we could get busted for that?
I'm sorry.
I need not know that.
Right now we got a bigger problem.
That is?
Beer's coming back up.
Oh, Lord!
Here we go!
Cops!
Dammit, Richard.
The whole car smells like beer.
They're never gonna believe i wasn't drinking.
Hold on!
What are you doing?
I got an idea.
What the hell?
When i stop the car, run out screaming.
No problem.
Little trick my dad taught me.
Bees!
Bees!
Bees in the car!
Bees everywhere!
God, they're huge!
They're ripping my flesh!
Son, roll around!
Do you hear me?
Roll around on the ground!
Forget that, i'm starting to swell up!
Save yourself, Tommy!
Don't be the hero!
Frank, i'm allergic to bees.
Me too.
They're huge and they sting crazy!
We'll come back later to check on you.
Save yourselves!
Your firearms are useless against them!
Holy shnikees, it worked!
I just barfed in an anthill.
Cool!
Wow, i think they're pissed.
Yeah.
That's the answer.
Doesn't look like the answer.
I don't remember eating that.
No!
Zalinsky.
We go to Chicago, tell him we're not for sale.
He seems like a good guy on TV.
He'll understand.
You're dreaming.
You can't stop him.
You lost your shares to the bank, remember?
What the hell?
In less than hs i'll lose the factory anyway.
So why not give it a shot?
Chicago?
Chicago.
You can't park here!
Keep it!
Where are you going?
Leave me a message and i'll get back to you.
Thanks.
Hi, Michelle.
This is Tommy.
Listen, i'm sorry about what i said.
I was being an idiot.
I wanna apologize cause, i didn't mean it.
Anyway, me and Richard are going to Chicago, to straighten things out.
The next flight to Chicago boards in five minutes but i'm sorry, it's completely sold out.
I can put you on another one at o'clock this afternoon.
Lady, we really need to get to Chicago.
It's an emergency.
Is there anything you can do?
I can put you in to Salt Lake City, by .
...
I don't have time to go thru another city.
I need a direct flight to Chicago.
Oh, i can reserve you a flight coming back from Chicago at .
...
Does that help?
Hi.
I'm Earth.
Have we met?
I don't think so.
So, i'll talk to you later.
Okay, bye.
We're screwed.
No tickets to Chicago.
Not even standby.
There's gotta be something we can do.
Wait a minute!
You got any money?
Cause i got a plan!
We're gonna get busted, let's get out of here!
Too late.
Hey, guess who's here!
What are we serving tonight, chicken or...
chicken?
What a nice surprise!
They said we were gonna be short-handed this leg.
You two take coach.
Oh, and could you handle the announcements?
Okey dokey.
No problemo.
They're gonna know we're bogus.
Relax!
You get on the horn!
I throw some peanuts at 'em.
We'll be in Chicago before you know it.
Ok, folks, the guy in front of you is Tommy.
He'll be taking you through my little spiel here.
Tommy is a Scorpio, he likes biking, and he's never been laid.
Exits!
Ok, there's one back here, and there's probably one over by the wing, somewhere, usually.
And what about seat belts?
To fasten, take the little end and stick it in the big end.
You know what, if you guys don't know how to use a seat belt, just ring the call button and Tommy will come back there and hit you on the head with a tack hammer cause you are a retard.
Ok, and life preservers.
These we may need.
Although what are the odds of us actually hitting a lake?
My money says if anything, it's gonna be a mountain.
To inflate, put it around your neck and yank down on the tab.
Son of a!
I can't breathe!
Chocking!
He's a big dumb animal, isn't he folks?
Folks, we're making our final approach into Chicago.
Ma'am, are you still alive?
Ma'am there's a half hour time limit.
Ok, now, we're running out of time, so you can't go see Zalinsky like that.
Now go change!
Go!
Fasten your seat belt.
I'm okay.
I'm fine, i'm fine now.
What are you doing?
I'm nervous so i'm sweating.
You're gonna smell like a cab driver.
Not to say that that's bad.
I wanna be fresh for the meeting.
Well, you look good.
Are you ready?
Ready or not, this is crunch time.
...
That's it!
Son of a...
That's gonna leave a mark.
Whoa, look at this place!
Welcome to the Pros.
Oh my God, it's him!
There he is, my friend.
The King himself.
Let's do it!
It's go time.
Where did he go?
I don't know.
You check the elevators, i'll check the bank.
Where is he?
where is he?
Listen up!
This'll only take a second!
Wow, what's going on down here?
Walk slow!
Okay.
Why?
Nothing.
Am i consorting with a known felon?
Shut up, Richard!
Hey mom!
It's the guy who robbed the bank!
I didn't rob any bank.
Oh, yeah, right.
Like there was other real fat guy with a tiny head.
I got a tiny head?
Zalinsky.
Say something!
Mr Zalinsky?
I'm Tommy Callahan.
Big Tom Callahan's son.
Sorry to hear about your dad.
He was a good man.
Went a little heavy on the pine tree perfume there, kid.
Sir, it's a taxi cab air-freshener.
Great, you've pinpointed it.
Step two is washing it off.
Sir, what exactly happened here?
He came out of the shadows behind me and after he hit me many many times in the head, with a hammer i had to give him my gun, you know, i've got kids.
So as more details emerge on this attempted bank robbery, Action will be there.
But the "Callahan" factory's been in my family for years, you can't just shut it down.
Son, you gotta look at it from my point of view.
Callahan's a premium name.
That's what i'm buying.
I can make the parts in one of my factories, put 'em in a Callahan box and sell 'em in my stores.
At a premium price.
Why keep your factory going when all i want is the goddamned box?
I'll tell you why.
Cause there's a town involved here.
Callahan factory is the only thing keeping it alive.
Look, believe it or not, i'm providing a service.
I'm thinning the corporate herd.
You've seen "Daktari"?
The weaker animals always go.
So the kids cry when you tie an old tiger to a tree and shoot him.
But that's life!
America's in a state of renewal.
We've gotta have the strength to tie a few factories to a tree and bash 'em with a shovel.
Meanwhile, if i can grab your share of the market, put a little coin in the pocket, by being the asshole?
Well, what the hell, you know what i mean?
Boy, you sure are different in your TV commercials.
What the American public doesn't know is what makes them the American public, alright?
God, i love that!
Hell, folks believe me when i tell them: we're not just building automotive components here we're adding horsepower to the American industry.
You say a word to anyone and i will kill you.
Do you understand me?
It looks real.
Yeah, television's been good to me, son.
I make car parts for the American working man, because that's what i am and that's who i care about.
The truth is i make car parts for the American working man because i'm a hell of a salesman, and he doesn't know any better.
Well, son, since you're no longer the shareholder, this is where i leave you.
Don't feel bad.
This chain of events was set in motion a long long time ago.
You and your bald headed friend, you did what you could, that's commendable.
Marty, have security see these boys out!
Mrs Callahan.
What's my family doing in there?
I thought they were on my side.
They had a lot to gain if the factory was sold.
Boy, did i screw up.
My so-called family deserted me.
Michelle's mad at me.
I lost the factory.
The town's going under and i'm out of a job.
Could have done without that.
Geez, i'm an idiot!
Boy, i sure let my dad down.
You tried as hard as you could.
When we first started out i thought you'd just walk through this like you walked through everything else.
But you didn't.
So your dad would've been proud o'you.
And you got a friend out of it.
Now, i know it doesn't matter cause you have so many, but uh...
...
i don't.
Thanks man.
Tommy.
Michelle!
Don't tell her about my hair!
Let it go!
God, i was worried i wouldn't find you.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I got your message.
Okay, i was at the airport.
I was going home.
And i saw your step-brother and your stepmother, and he was kissing her.
So?
With his tongue.
Doing his mommy?
She's not his mom.
They're married.
They were lying to your dad the whole time.
And my brother got these police reports.
See?
They lied to my dad?
They're con artists.
They suckered him.
They lied to my dad.
Richard, i'm gonna need your watch.
I've got a plan.
Folks, Mr Zalinsky gave us specific instructions to bar you from the building.
Sorry boys.
Hopefully we'll just be in and out.
My God, he's wired!
And uh, no cops.
Wouldn't want things to get messy.
That was fun.
Now what?
Well, it's o'clock, time for the news.
Excuse me!
Oh God.
Done this before?
Thank you, Marty.
My, your hands move quickly!
Only when i see something i want, Mrs Callahan.
Just doesn't seem right.
Hi!
Got a second?
What the hell's going on?
Oh, my God, we're gonna die!
Tommy, what are you doing?
Hi, Ted.
Hi, Frank.
Excuse me, Marty.
Okay, we're live.
We now switch live to our reporter who's at the scene with the bomber.
This is Nicole Taylor, live from Chicago.
Hey, look!
It's Tommy!
Nicole, i've got something to say.
Please, may i?
Hi.
This is Tommy Callahan here with Mr Ray Zalinsky, American auto-parts king.
Honey, look at this human-bomb on the news!
Oh yeah, i buy brake pads off him.
I thought we were watching cartoons.
Mr Zalinsky, for years you've been putting ads on TV.
And they always end up with you saying: "I make car parts for..." How does that go?
I make car parts for the American working man, because that's what i am and that's who i care about.
That's why i'm here, Ray.
You see, back in Sandusky, Ohio, there are American workers at "Callahan Auto".
We make the best parts money can buy.
And right now those workers are in danger of losing their jobs.
They're praying that somebody's gonna step up and help 'em.
Is that why you've strapped a bomb to your chest?
Oh, this isn't a bomb.
These are road flares.
Road flares?
Did you live under power lines as a kid or something?
Why?
Do you guys want this or "American Gladiators"?
"Gladiators".
So, do you think "Zalinsky Industries" can help these folks?
I'll be happy to look into it.
I'll tell you what, i can get a good look at a T-bone by sticking my head up a bull's ass, but i'd rather take the butcher's word for it.
Am i just severely wasted or does Tommy look bloated?
No, it's TV, man.
Camera adds a couple...
pounds.
Ray, we're not looking for a handout here.
I'm offering you a great deal.
This is an order for half-a-million "Callahan" brake pads, to be sold in your stores.
Made by the American working man, for the American working man.
Absolutely.
It'd be my great pleasure.
What have i got to lose?
A great American product, right?
I don't believe it.
Tommy just sold half a million brake pads.
Tommy just sold a half million brake pads!
What difference does it make?
The company's gonna be mine in ten minutes anyway.
Right?
Mr Zalinsky, thank you.
Thank you Tommy boy.
And thank you.
And remember you can pick up these great brake pads from "Callahan Auto" all my "Zalinsky Auto Parts" outlets all over North America!
Bravo, Tommy!
For the moment it looks like a tragedy has been eluded and a town has been saved.
For Action News, i'm Nicole Taylor, reporting live.
Okay, we're out of here!
Wait a minute, fat boy!
You lost your shares to the bank.
You don't even have a right to be here.
Gee, funny you should bring that up.
'Cause i'm not sure that you have the right to be here.
What have we got here?
Oh my God, it's a police report!
What's all this about?
Let's see!
Paul Barrish, married May to Beverly Barrish, a.k.a.
Beverly Burns.
Richard, how could Beverly be married to Paul and my dad at the same time?
Interesting.
Yes.
Provocative.
Well, i think it means that your marriage to my dad was never legal.
Which also means that Beverly's shares still belong to Tommy.
Isn't that right, Mr Rittenhauer?
Yes.
I believe that's right.
Mr Railly?
I'd say that's right.
Mr Gilmore?
Oh, absolutely.
And let me guess, you're not going to be selling me the company now, are you Tommy boy?
No sir.
Ray, i have no idea what they're talking about.
That's it!
You're not gonna take this.
It's not over yet, Lee Harvey.
Let's see.
Warrants outstanding!
New Mexico: mail fraud.
Colorado: wire fraud.
And coming soon to Ohio: computer fraud.
Get him!
Don't let him leave the complex, Marty!
Hey, you forgot your wife!
Screw you!
Screw all of you!
Crash Test in Progress.
Not good.
Hit the brakes!
That will ruin his weekend.
Well kid, you threw one by me.
Savour the flavour, cause it sure as hell won't happen again.
In the meantime, good luck to you.
Thank you sir.
Marty, cut a check to Callahan Auto for those brake pads!
And you, with all this excitement around here, i kinda'got a little hungry.
Wanna step over to my club and have something to eat?
Thank you.
I'd like that.
Good.
Marty, find out where the police will be taking him!
send over a bottle of bubbly with a bucket of ice and a card.
Have it say: "Tough break, get drunk on me...
use the bucket to ice down your marbles, yours Z." Well, Mr Callahan, looks like we're back in business.
Yes sir, Mr Rittenhauer.
That's great, Tommy!
Thanks.
Way to go, Tommy Callahan!
That was pathetic.
Shut up, Richard!
It's a very proud day for me.
I want to introduce you to the new president of "Callahan Auto", Tom Callahan Junior.
Tommy, will you say something!
Ever since i was a kid, you people have been like a family to me.
Louis, we built our first fort together.
And Danny, remember when we used to burn ants with a magnifying glass?
R.T., i lost my virginity to your daughter, for crying out loud!
Rob, you were there.
Anyway, i just want you to know that as long as i'm around, i'm gonna bust my butt and make sure that every last one of you always has a job, right here at "Callahan".
Dad, got a little problem here.
I've been stuck here for an hour with no wind again.
I'm supposed to be at Michelles'for dinner.
So if you could give me a little help, i'd appreciate it.
If not, don't worry about it.
I'm trying to do everything i think you'd be doing, and so far it's going pretty good.
I just wanna tell you that...
i still love you and i sure miss you a lot.
Hey, thanks dad!
Son of a...!
That's gonna leave a mark!
Morning, Scott.
Morning, Wells.
Ghost Rider, we have an unknown aircraft.
Vector 090 for bogey.
Who's up there?
Cougar, Merlin, Maverick and Goose.
Great.
Maverick and Goose.
Talk to me, Goose.
Roger, I got them.
900 knots closure.
Cougar, you hear that?
Roger.
Merlin, you got them?
I've got radar contact.
I'll get a visual ID.
You hook them.
I'll clean them and fry them.
Ghost Rider, .
I have them inbound, bogey heading at miles.
knots closure.
Take angels left, .
Are we expecting visitors?
Negative, sir.
Merlin, see if he's a single.
Roger.
Do you see a trailer?
Looks like he's a single.
I'm gonna go head-to-head with him.
Take it easy.
I'll see if he's really alone.
He's coming right at us, Mav.
Okay, buddy.
What's on your mind?
Shit, there's two of them.
MiG s!
What?
What's their position?
miles out, sir.
Get them out of here!
Cougar, you've got MiG one.
I'm going after MiG two.
I lost him in the sun!
Shit, what's he doing?
You got him, Merlin?
He's coming around on our tail!
Goddamn it.
This bogey's all over me.
What's their range now?
If they break miles, launch the alert five aircraft.
Airspeed .
Go get them, Mav!
I'm going for missile lock.
Let's see if we can scare him out of here.
Lock up, baby.
I've got him locked.
Bingo!
We got him, Mav.
He's bugging out.
Mustang, MiG two is headed home.
What's their position?
miles and bearing sir.
He's got missile lock on us!
He's engaging me.
Goddamn it.
Mustang, this bogey's all over me.
Do I have permission to fire?
Do not fire until fired upon.
There they are.
The MiG's in perfect firing position.
No way.
He would have fired by now.
Maverick, get this asshole off me!
Easy, Cougar.
Bring him back, hard right.
Help me engage.
I'm on my way.
I can't shoot, so let's have a little fun.
Is this your idea of fun?
Greetings.
Watch the birdie.
Geez, I crack myself up.
Great shot.
I should be a photographer.
Cougar, your tail is clear.
MiG one has bugged out.
Cougar, we've had enough fun for one day, don't you think?
I'm getting low on fuel, so we're heading home.
We'll see you on deck.
We're running low on gas.
Cougar?
We're on vapour.
Let's do it.
Cougar, come on!
Let's take it back to the ship, man.
Get him on deck as soon as possible.
Cougar, we've got to land this thing.
We are way low on gas.
Are you all right?
Maverick, call the ball.
Roger.
Maverick has the ball.
Cougar's in trouble.
Come on, we're getting low on gas.
Let's land this sucker.
Cougar!
Goddamn it!
We've got no fuel for this.
We're going after Cougar.
Tell him to land.
That's an order!
You're instructed to land immediately.
Have you boys seen an aircraft carrier?
That MiG really screwed him up.
I don't think he can make it back.
You're okay, Cougar.
Just stay on my wing.
I'll take you all the way in.
Easy, Cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.
You're a little low.
You're a little low.
Come on, buddy, pull up.
Pull up, Cougar.
That's it.
Almost there.
A little below glide path.
Call the ball.
Roger ball.
You're too low.
Increase power!
Come in.
What's on your mind?
My wife and kid, sir.
I almost orphaned him today.
I've never even seen him.
I was so scared.
We've seen this before.
No, sir.
I'm holding on too tight.
I've lost the edge.
I'm sorry, sir.
Cougar?
Thanks, Maverick.
Maverick, Goose, come in here.
What the hell's going on?
I don't know.
Shit.
Maverick, you just did an incredibly brave thing.
What you should have done was land your plane.
It belongs to the taxpayers!
Your ego's writing cheques your body can't cash.
You've lost your qualifications as section leader three times.
Put in hack twice by me with a history of high-speed passes - Over five air control towers and one admiral's daughter!
Penny Benjamin?
You, asshole, you're lucky to be here.
Let's not bullshit.
Your family name ain't the best in the Navy.
You need to be doing it better and cleaner than the other guy.
Just want to serve my country, sir.
Don't screw around with me.
You're a hell of a pilot.
Maybe too good.
I'd like to bust your butt - But I have another problem here.
I have to send somebody to Miramar.
I've got to do something.
I can't believe it.
I have to give you your dream shot.
I have to send you up against the best.
You characters are going to Top Gun.
For five weeks, you're going to fly against the best.
You were number two.
Cougar was number one.
He turned in his wings.
You guys are number one.
But you remember one thing: You screw up, you'll be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit.
Yes, sir!
That is all.
Tell me about the MiG some other time.
Gentlemen?
Good luck, gentlemen.
Thank you, sir.
During Korea, we shot down of theirjets for every one of ours.
During Vietnam, that ratio fell to .
Our pilots were dependant on missiles.
Top Gun was created to teach ACM.
Air Combat Manoeuvring.
Dogfighting.
This gives me a hard-on.
By the end of Vietnam, it was .
Don't tease me.
Blinds, please.
Our commanding officer was the very first man to win the Top Gun trophy.
You won't find a finer fighter pilot anywhere.
Commander Mike Metcalf.
Call sign, Viper.
Gentlemen...
You're the top one percent of all naval aviators.
The elite.
The best of the best.
We'll make you better.
You fly at least two combat missions a day, attend classes and evaluations.
On each combat sequence you're gonna meet a different challenge.
We'll teach you to fly the F faster than you've ever flown before.
Now, we don't make policy here.
Elected officials, civilians, do that.
We are their instruments and must always act as though we are at war.
What are you doing?
Just wondering who's the best.
In case some of you wonder who the best is, they're on this plaque.
The best driver and his RIO from each class has his name on it.
They have the option to come back here and be Top Gun instructors.
You think you will be on the plaque?
Yes, sir.
That's pretty arrogant, considering the company you're in.
Yes, sir.
I like that in a pilot.
Remember, when it's over out there, we're all on the same team.
This school is about combat.
There are no points for second place.
Dismissed.
Nice going.
The plaque for the alternates is down in the ladies'room.
Jesus...
You kill me.
You really do...
There's two O's in Goose, boys.
This I call a target-rich environment.
You live your life between your legs.
Even you could get laid in here.
I'd be happy to find a girl who'd talk dirty to me.
You wanted to know who the best is?
That's him.
Iceman.
He flies ice-cold.
No mistakes.
Wears you down.
You get bored, do something stupid, and he's got you.
I thought you wanted to be a pilot.
Whose butt did you kiss to get here?
The list is long but distinguished.
So is my johnson.
So you're flying with Iceman?
Hey, Mother Goose, how's it going?
Tom, this is Pete Mitchell.
Tom Kazansky.
Congratulations on Top Gun.
Sorry to hear about Cougar.
He was a good man.
Still is a good man.
Yeah, that's what I meant.
You need any help?
You figured it out yet?
What's that?
Who's the best pilot.
I can figure that one out on my own.
I heard that about you.
You like to work alone.
You're lucky.
First the MiG and then you slide into Cougar's spot.
We didn't slide into Cougar's spot.
Some pilots wait a whole career to see a MiG up close.
Lucky and famous?
You mean notorious.
See you later.
You can count on it.
They were abused children.
We're gonna have a good time.
Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?
All right, the bet is dollars.
You have to have carnal knowledge, of a lady this time, on the premises.
On the premises.
Come on, a bet's a bet.
I don't know, it just doesn't seem fair...
for you, I mean.
But...
She's lost that loving feeling.
No, she hasn't.
She has not lost...
She's lost it, man.
Come on.
I hate it when she does that.
Excuse me, miss.
Don't worry.
I'll take care of this.
Sit down.
Thank you.
I love that song.
That's a new approach.
How long have you been doing this act?
I don't know.
Since...
Puberty?
I'm Charlotte Blackwood.
I'm Maverick.
Did your mother not like you?
No, it's my call sign.
You're a pilot?
That's right.
A naval aviator.
Actually, we've only done this twice.
How did you do?
Crashed and burned on the first one.
And the second?
I'll tell you tomorrow.
But it's looking good so far.
Well, Maverick.
My friend just arrived, so it's been great talking to you.
Perry.
I'll be with you in just a second.
Can I ask you a personal question?
That depends.
Are you a good pilot?
I can hold my own.
Great.
Then I won't have to worry about you making your living as a singer.
I'm gonna need a beer to put these flames out.
Great, Mav.
Real slick.
A long cruise, was it, sailor?
Too long.
You want to just drop down on the tile and go for it?
I actually had this counter in mind.
That would be very comfortable, yeah.
It could be.
I came in here to save you from making a big mistake with that older guy.
Really?
So I could go on to a bigger one with a young guy like yourself?
Maybe.
I have to get up early in the morning.
What are you doing?
Your friend was magnificent.
You'll also be trained and evaluated by civilian specialists.
They are our best source of information on enemy aircraft.
One of the most qualified is call sign Charlie, with a Ph.D.
in astrophysics.
Listen to her, because the Pentagon listens to her about your proficiency.
All yours, Charlie.
Hello.
We will be dealing with Fs and As as our MiG simulators.
As you know, the F doesn't have the thrust-to-weight ratio of the MiG .
And it doesn't bleed energy below knots like the MiG .
However, the MiG does have a problem with its inverted flight tanks.
It won't do a negative G push-over.
The latest intelligence tells us the most it will do is...
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Is there something wrong?
The data on the MiG is inaccurate.
How's that?
Well, I just happened to see a MiG ...
Sorry, Goose.
We happened to see a MiG do a four G negative dive.
Where did you see this?
That's classified.
I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
I have Top Secret clearance.
The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
Well, it doesn't seem to be the case.
So, where exactly were you?
We started up on his six when he pulled through the clouds.
I went above him.
If you were directly above him, how could you see him?
Because I was inverted.
Bullshit.
No, he was, man.
It was a really great move.
You were in a four G inverted dive with a MiG?
Yes, ma'am.
At what range?
About two metres?
/ .
I have a great Polaroid of it.
It was a nice picture.
Lieutenant?
What were you doing there?
Communicating.
Keeping up foreign relations.
I was, you know, giving him the bird.
You know, the finger.
I know the finger.
I hate it when it does that.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
So you're the one?
Yes, ma'am.
All right, we have a hop to take.
The hard-deck on this is feet.
There'll be no engagement below that.
Move it!
Lieutenant!
Don't be late again.
You look great, honey.
Why didn't you tell me you were the famous MiG Insulter?
Would it have made any difference?
Not in the ladies'room.
I see new hotshots every eight weeks.
I'm sure you can figure that out.
I'd just really like to hear about the MiG sometime.
You've got security clearance.
You can read about it.
Maverick?
I'm curious.
Who was covering Cougar while you were showboating with his MiG?
Cougar was doing just fine.
This is your first hop.
Thejets you're flying against are smaller and faster, just like the enemy MiGs.
As of now we are keeping score.
I lost him, Goose.
Show me what you've got, kid.
I lost him.
I'm looking.
He's on our tail, coming hard.
I got him.
Here we go.
Talk to me, Goose.
He's still back there.
Closing in on us.
You can run, kid, but you can't hide.
All right, Jester, I'll give you a run for your money here.
Watch the mountains!
He's still back there.
Come on, Mav, do some of that pilot shit.
Come on, bring it right.
I've had about enough of this shit.
I'll hit the brakes, he'll fly right by.
You're mine.
Jesus Christ!
Let's see what you've got now, Jester.
Let's turn and burn.
He's going vertical.
So am I.
We're going ballistic.
Go get him!
He's going for the hard-deck.
Let's nail him.
No way, Jester.
You're mine.
I've got you now!
Jester's dead.
Jester's dead.
Get your butts above the hard-deck and return to base.
Yes, sir!
This is Ghost Rider requesting a fly-by.
Negative.
The pattern is full.
No, Mav.
This is not a good idea.
Sorry, but it's time to buzz the tower.
Goddamn son of a bitch!
Great balls of fire.
Jester's dead.
You won?
Bullshit.
Didn't everybody?
We got our butts kicked.
I said to Hollywood, "Where did he go?" He said, "Where did who go?" And he's laughing at us on the radio.
That was me, dickhead.
We won.
All right!
They won too, man.
That's not what I heard.
We got Jester.
Below the hard-deck doesn't count.
We nailed that son of a bitch.
You guys really are cowboys.
What's your problem, Kazansky?
You're everyone's problem.
Every time you fly, you're unsafe.
I don't like you.
You're dangerous.
That's right, Iceman.
I am dangerous.
Maverick?
You and Goose get your butts up to Viper's office, now!
Remember, no points for second place.
You're a lot brighter than you look.
You shut up.
Two of your snot-nosed jockeys flew by by at over knots.
I want their butts!
Damn it, that's twice.
I want some butts!
That just about covers the fly-bys.
Follow me.
Gentlemen.
You had a hell of a first day.
The hard-deck for this hop was feet.
You knew it.
You broke it.
You followed Commander Heatherly below after he lost sight of you.
Why?
Sir, I had him in my sights.
He saw me move in for the kill.
He proceeded below the hard-deck.
We were below forjust a few seconds.
I had the shot.
There was no danger, so I took it.
You took it, and broke a major rule of engagement.
Then you broke another one with that circus stunt fly-by.
Top Gun rules of engagement exist for your safety and for that of your team.
They're not flexible, nor am I.
Obey them or you're history.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir!
Dismissed.
I really enjoyed that, Mav, thanks a lot.
Holy shit.
Maybe I could be a truck driver.
You got the number of that truck-driving school?
Fitness report says it all.
He's a wild card.
Completely unpredictable.
He got you, didn't he?
Yeah.
Maverick.
I flew with his old man.
Tell me, if you had to go into battle, would you want him with you?
I just don't know.
Still awake?
Yeah.
What's up?
I can't sleep.
When I realised we were off to Top Gun, all I could think about was that trophy.
I've got to be straight with you, Mav.
Right now, I just hope we graduate.
I got a family to think about.
I can't afford to blow this.
I guess that fly-by wasn't such a big hit, huh?
I know it's tough.
The Academy rejected you because you're Duke Mitchell's kid.
You have to live with that reputation.
But it's like you're flying against a ghost.
It makes me nervous.
You're the only family I've got.
I'm not gonna let you down.
I promise.
Get out of here.
A rolling reversal would work well in that situation.
If I reversed on a hard cross, I could go to guns on him.
But at that speed, it's too fast.
It's a little bit too aggressive.
Too aggressive?
I guess when I see something, I go right after it.
You didn't tell me who you were.
I didn't get a chance.
You deserved it.
I know...
but you were tempted to ask me out for dinner.
No.
I don't date students.
I can see it's dangerous for you.
But if the government trusts me...
...maybe you could.
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.
Crash and burn, huh, Mav?
Slider...
You stink.
Let's go!
Come on, Mav.
Just one more game.
That evens it up.
I got some things to take care of.
Just one more game.
Please?
For me?
Come on...
For me?
Damn it.
Lieutenant?
What?
No singing?
Look, I'm...
No apologies.
If you don't mind, I'll just take a quick shower while you're finishing up here.
I do mind.
I'm hungry.
And then I thought about it.
I thought, "You know, he's a smart guy." "Why don't you just tell him why you've got him here?" It's the MiG.
The MiG.
You're the only pilot who's been up against a MiG .
I'm trying for this big promotion.
If I get it, I won't be here much longer.
Seems to me you've got it all figured out.
Except you did forget the wine.
Sorry.
You always get what you want?
No, not always.
Yeah, maybe.
Then relax about the MiG.
This music...
An old friend?
My folks loved it.
I haven't heard this in years.
My mother used to call from her room and have me play this over and over.
I got so sick of it.
But not her.
She'd sit up there alone, just listening for hours.
Just listening.
She died shortly after him.
What happened to your father?
I figured with your security clearance you'd know more about it than I do.
Well, I didn't get that far.
It's a big mystery.
He disappeared in an F November th, .
The stink of it was...
he screwed up.
No way.
My old man was a great fighter pilot.
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.
Somebody must know.
Yeah, somebody knows everything.
Is that why you're always second best up there?
You are direct, aren't you.
I'm sorry I was late.
I'm sorry for being direct.
No apologies.
This is going to be complicated.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna take a shower.
Thank you.
I enjoyed being here.
It looks like you need another shower.
Right.
I'm gonna be honest with you.
Your MiG sighting is really important to my work, but...
I don't normally invite students to my house.
You're...
But please understand, I still have a job to do.
I'm glad we got that straight.
I told her how tough it is here.
My ass dragging like an old tired dog.
I told her you didn't even have a woman.
She said, "He probably doesn't have one, but eight." Hi!
Daddy.
Goose tells me you're in love with one of your instructors.
I didn't tell her that.
I can't believe you said that.
That was a secret.
The bogey has good position right here.
Freeze frame.
A moment of choice.
The F is defensive.
He has a chance to bug out right here.
Better to retire and save your aircraft than push a bad position.
Charlie, jump in here any time.
You stay in that diamond another three seconds.
The bogey's gonna blow you away.
You take a hard right, select zone five...
You can extend an escape.
You made a bad choice.
Charlie?
Aircraft one performs a split S?
That's the last thing you should do.
The MiG's right on your tail.
Freeze there.
The MiG has you in his gunsight.
What were you thinking?
You don't have time to think up there.
If you think, you're dead.
That's a big gamble with a $ million plane.
Unfortunately, it worked.
The MiG never got a clean shot.
Maverick makes an aggressive vertical move and defeats him with a missile.
The encounter was a victory, but we show it as an example of what not to do.
Next.
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.
Now then, this is a perfect example of a textbook manoeuvre.
Lieutenant?
My review of your performance was right on, in my professional opinion.
I can't hear you.
Jesus!
And you call me reckless?
When I fly, my crew and my plane come first.
I'm gonna finish my sentence.
My review of your performance was right on.
I see some real genius in your flying, but I can't say that in there.
I was afraid they'd see right through me.
I don't want anyone to know that I've fallen for you.
Hey, Maverick?
Hear about Ice?
What's that?
He won another one.
Really?
I fell the need...
the need for speed.
This is hop .
Multiple aircraft, multiple bogeys.
Your training is half over.
The competition for the trophy remains tight.
First place, Iceman.
Second, Maverick, two points behind.
There they are.
Three miles, o'clock.
I see them.
Two As.
Left o'clock level.
Continue left turn.
Good morning.
The temperature is .
Viper's up here?
Great.
Oh, shit.
He's probably saying, "Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose." I've got my eye on the northern bogey.
Roger, I've got the southern guy.
Hollywood, you lead.
I'll cover you.
Break now, Jester.
We're losing Viper.
Let's just stay on Jester.
Goose, find Viper.
He's out there.
Stay with Hollywood.
There's Viper.
Three o'clock low.
We're Hollywood's cover.
Don't you leave me.
Hollywood, you're looking good.
I'm going after Viper.
Goddamn you!
Don't leave him.
Hollywood's okay.
I want Viper.
Viper's coming down.
Holy shit.
We're head-to-head.
Rock and roll!
Here's our big chance.
Come on, goddamn it.
Come on, keep coming.
Okay, sidewinder missile selected.
Come on, baby.
Come around.
That's it.
Jesus, he's good.
Where's he going?
Come on, come on.
Keep coming.
Come on, baby.
Damn, this kid's good.
He's too close for missiles.
I'm switching to guns.
Come on, come on.
Stick with it...
Hold it.
Check our tail.
Shit, there's Jester!
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.
The Defence Department regrets to inform you your sons died of stupidity.
Knock it off, gentlemen.
Let's go home.
Viper has the lead.
seconds, Wolfman.
I'm coming in.
Shut up!
That was some of the best flying I've seen yet.
Until you got killed.
You never, never leave your wingman.
Maverick...
It's not your flying, it's your attitude.
The enemy's dangerous, but right now you're worse.
Dangerous and foolish.
You may not like who's flying with you, but whose side are you on?
At least Viper got Iceman before he got us.
We've still got a shot at it.
That was stupid, I know better than that.
That will never happen again.
I know...
I know.
Go fetch him.
Doesn't he ever embarrass you?
Hell no.
Well, there was the time...
Admiral's daughter.
He told me all about the time you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.
Did he?
Great.
He tells me about all of them.
My angel Goose goes home early for church.
You go home with the hot women.
Thank you, Carole.
I'm gonna go embarrass myself with Goose for a while.
I'd love to be able to warn you off about Maverick, but I just love him to death.
I've known Pete for a lot of years.
One thing's for certain.
There are hearts breaking wide open all over the world tonight.
Unless you are a fool, that boy is off the market.
Hey, Goose, you big stud.
Take me to bed or lose me forever.
Show me the way home, honey.
Come on, brother, sing with the family.
Maverick, you big stud...
Take me to bed or lose me forever.
This is hop .
Two weeks to graduation.
The Top Gun trophy is still up for grabs.
The score is tied.
Time for the big one.
Are you up for this one, Maverick?
Just a walk in the park.
Contact.
Multiple bogeys.
Two miles.
Looks like they're going away from us.
I see them.
Right, two o'clock.
I'm in.
I'm in.
That son of a bitch cut me off.
Come on.
Jesus Christ, Ice.
Take the shot.
Get the hell out of there.
I can't get the angle.
I'm too close.
I'm switching to guns.
Fire or clear!
Christ, I can take a shot right here.
seconds and I've got him.
I'm moving in.
I've got the shot.
Come on, Mav.
He's getting impatient.
Take the shot.
more seconds.
Get the hell out of there.
Come off my right.
I'm in.
Five more seconds.
I'm in.
I'm off.
Shit.
We're in a jetwash.
Shit!
This is not good.
We've got a flame-out.
Engine one is out...
Engine two is out.
I'm losing control.
I can't control it!
It's coupling up.
This is not good!
Mayday, mayday.
Mav's in trouble.
He's in a flat spin heading out to sea!
Altitude ...
...
We're at!
I can't reach the ejection handle!
You're gonna have to punch us out.
I can't reach the ejection handle!
Eject...
Watch the canopy!
Goose...
Oh, no!
Oh, God.
Sir, let go of him.
You've got to let him go, sir.
How are you doing?
I'm all right.
Goose is dead.
I know.
You fly jets long enough, something like this happens.
He was my RIO, my responsibility.
In my squadron in Vietnam, we lost of aircraft.
men.
The first one dies, you die too.
But there will be others.
You can count on it.
You've got to let him go.
You've got to let him go.
I think maybe it was my fault.
I don't know.
I don't know what the hell went wrong.
I'd like to help.
I know it's difficult.
God, I want him back.
I'll be here if you need me, okay?
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.
He would have flown anyway...
without you.
He'd have hated it, but he would have done it.
The spin was induced by the disruption of air flow into the starboard engine.
This disruption stalled the engine.
Which produced enough yaw rate to induce a spin - Which was unrecoverable.
There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell could see or avoid the jetwash.
The Board of Inquiry finds that he was not at fault in the accident of July.
His record will be cleared.
He's restored to flight status without further delay.
These proceedings are closed.
Get him up flying, soon.
Come on, kid.
Get in there.
Engage.
You've got a bogey at two o'clock.
Take the shot, kid.
You can engage any time, Maverick.
Where the hell are you going?
It doesn't look good.
What do you mean?
It doesn't get to look any better than that.
Hey, man.
We could have had him...
I'll fire when I'm goddamn good and ready.
You got that?
He won't engage.
It's only been a few days.
He just might not make it back.
Keep sending him up.
Mitchell?
I'm sorry about Goose.
Everybody liked him.
I'm sorry.
Hi, it's Wolfman.
Maverick just quit.
Excuse me...
May I?
Please.
I'll have what he's having.
Hemlock, is it?
Ice water.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
I heard you got that job in Washington.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
But I wasn't gonna leave without saying goodbye.
It's good to see you.
Thanks.
Where are you going?
You don't even have a ticket, do you?
I've seen all the evidence, and it's not your responsibility.
It's not your fault.
You're one of the best pilots in the Navy.
What you do up there...
It's dangerous.
But you've got to go on.
You don't understand.
When I first met you, you were larger than life.
Look at you.
You're not gonna be happy unless you're going Mach with your hair on fire.
No, that's over.
It's just over.
To be the best of the best means you make mistakes and then you go on.
You don't think I know that?
I'm here to help.
Look, thank you.
If I'd wanted help, I would have asked for it.
So, I'm too late.
You've already left.
You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?
Except to quit.
You've got that manoeuvre down real well.
So long, Pete Mitchell.
Hi, Maverick, come on in.
How are you?
Sure you're feeling okay?
Great.
Jamie, come on.
Can I get you a drink?
Make yourself comfortable.
Mike will be right down.
I flew with your old man.
VF the Oriskany.
You're a lot like he was.
Only better...
and worse.
He was a natural heroic son of a bitch.
So he did do it right.
Yeah, he did it right.
Is that why you fly the way you do?
Trying to prove something?
Yeah, your old man did it right.
What I'm about to tell you is classified.
It could end my career.
We were in the worst dogfight ever.
Bogeys like fireflies all over the sky.
His F was hit.
He was wounded, but he stayed.
Saved three planes before he bought it.
How come I never heard that before?
The battle occurred over the wrong line on some map.
So you were there?
I was there.
What's on your mind?
My options, sir.
Simple.
You've acquired enough points - To show up tomorrow and graduate with your class.
Or you could quit.
There'll be no disgrace.
That spin was hell.
So you think I should quit?
I didn't say that.
You feel responsible for Goose.
And you have a confidence problem.
I won't blow sunshine up your ass.
A good pilot is compelled to evaluate what's happened - And apply what he's learned.
Up there, we've got to push it.
That's ourjob.
It's your option, Lieutenant.
All yours.
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir.
Thank you for your time.
No problem.
Good luck.
Gentlemen...
Where's Maverick?
I don't know where he is.
You know what he's planning to do?
It's got to be hard on the guy though.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Thanks, Mav.
Gentlemen, I hate to break up the party before it gets out of hand...
Some of you have to depart immediately.
We have a crisis situation.
Ice, Slider...
Hollywood, Wolfman.
Maverick.
Sir.
Maverick, you'll get your RIO when you get to the ship.
If you don't...
...give me a call.
I'll fly with you.
The SS Layton has become disabled and has wandered into foreign territory.
A rescue operation will soon begin.
Your mission is to give it air support.
There are MiGs in the area.
If you witness a hostile act, return fire.
They carry the Exocet anti-ship missile.
They can fire it from miles away.
This is the real thing.
This is what you've been trained for.
Make us proud.
Ice...
Hollywood, sector two.
Maverick, you back them up with Merlin on ready five.
Yes, sir.
Rise.
Excuse me, sir.
This is not personal.
But is Maverick the best pilot to ...
?
I know what's on your mind.
Get on it.
You've got a pair of bogeys, o'clock, miles.
Voodoo One, radar contact miles.
They're doing knots.
Roger, that's your bogey.
Dead ahead, miles, knots.
They're at feet now, miles.
knots.
Dead ahead now, eight miles.
Wood, you got them?
They must be close.
I'm getting a hard-on.
I'm taking the lead.
Let's identify them.
Roger.
I'm on your left side, a little low.
Maverick's up and ready in alert five.
My bogey's still locked up.
He's drifting to the left.
Still manoeuvring, course .
Let's bring it to the right.
Ice, we've got a problem.
I have four aircraft on radar.
Four bogeys.
Wood, we've got four bogeys.
Wrong, make that five!
There's five, sir.
Oh, shit!
He's got a radar lock on us.
Get out of there, Hollywood!
I'm hit.
We're coming apart.
I can't control it!
We're going down.
Wood's been hit.
Wood's been hit!
Voodoo One, Wood's been hit.

I'm going after them.
I'm bringing it around to the left.

That makes six of them!
He's firing.
Break right.
This is Voodoo One.
We are defensive.
Launch the alert fighters!

Ready Willard and Simkin.
I'll be there in seconds.

Get control!
Good recovery.
Let's get in there and help Ice.
Let's get back in the game.
No, it's no good.
Goddamn it.
Maverick's disengaging.
I knew it.
Shit!
Get in there, come on.
What the hell are you doing?
Ice won't last down there alone...
Talk to me, Goose.
Maverick!
Maverick's re-engaging, sir.
I can't get him off my tail.
I've got your MiG dead ahead.
I got tone.
Firing!
Where are they?
miles.
Two MiGs dead ahead.
I see them.
I'll take it left.
Oh, my God.
Ice is right below with a MiG on his tail.
He's firing.
Break left!
He overshot!
Coming in, Ice.
I got two MiGs, dead ahead.
One MiG passing between us.
You've got a MiG on your left.
He's gonna fire!
Check the guy to the north!
Banking left.
There he is.
Get him, Ice!
Okay, you guys, I'm coming in.
A MiG's coming round on our tail.
I can't leave Ice.
He's gonna get behind us!
I'm not leaving my wingman.
I'm on his tail.
I'm going for the shot right now.
Roger, engaged!
I've got radar lock.
I'm taking the shot.
Fire!
Bingo!
Watch out, there's a MiG to your right.
He's firing!
I'm hit.
We're hit in the right engine.
I'm shutting it down.
Coming in, Ice.
That bogey's still behind you.
I'm manoeuvring for a shot.
Take the shot.
I can't get a tone.
Shoot.
I can't get him off my tail.
We're hit again.
We're okay.
On the count of three, break hard right.
Three...

Firing!
Damn it, I missed.
Don't let him go.
I got him.
Here comes the shot.
Strike three.
There's a MiG on your tail.
We've only got one missile left.
miles, sir.
I got him.
He's on our tail.
He's still with us.
You're slowing down.
I'm bringing him in closer.
This is it.
I'll hit the brakes.
He'll fly right by us.
Now!
I've got a good lock.
Firing.
Strike four!
This is Voodoo Three.
Remaining MiGs are bugging out.
This is Maverick, requesting fly-by.
Negative, the pattern is full.
Is there something I should know about?
Goddamn that guy.
You!
You are still dangerous.
But you can be my wingman anytime.
Bullshit.
You can be mine.
Maverick?
You're on the front pages of all the English-speaking world.
Even though the other side denies the incident, congratulations.
They gave you your choice of duty, son.
Where do you think you want to go?
I thought of being an instructor, sir.
Top Gun?
Yes, sir.
God help us.
Hello, Pete Mitchell.
I heard the best of the best were gonna be back here, so...
This could be complicated.
You know, on the first one, I crashed and burned.
And the second?
I don't know.
Excuse me, can you tell me if Delmare Berry lives here?
He's not here.
Go in.
He's a friend of mine, he wrote the address for me himself.
ln here.
See?
That's Delmare's handwriting.
This place is hard to find.
That's his writing.
Yes, we're friends.
l'm John Rambo.
We were together in Vietnam.
Maybe he mentioned me.
l've got a photo of us both.
Somewhere.
All this junk in my pocket!
Here...here it is.
That's me, that's Danforth, Westmore, Bronson, Ortega, and at the back is Delmare.
He had to stand at the back, or he'd have filled the whole picture.
Delmare's gone.
When's he coming back?
He died.
What?
He died last summer.
How?
Cancer.
Must have got it in Vietnam.
From the orange stuff they sprayed around there.
He weighed nothing at the end, l could lift him out of bed like that!
l'm real sorry.

How are you, girls?
Fine, thanks.

And second: we don't want people like you here in our town.
Drifters.
Before you know it there's a whole pile of people like you.
That's why!
Besides, you wouldn't like it here, it's a quiet place.
Some would even call it boring.
But we like it that way.
l get paid to keep it like that.
Boring.
Straight on for Portland.
Want some friendly advice?
Get your hair cut and take a bath.
Then you'll avoid trouble.

And clean him up a little.
He stinks like an animal!

Now roll it over there.
Roll it over!
Press it on.
Not like that, it'll smear.
Roll it over!
Put your hand on there, asshole, or l'll break it off!
Put it on there, dammit!
What the hell's going on down here?
Everything under control.
He won't have his fingerprints taken.
Leave the ink on!
What's your problem?
Looks like you're going to jail for days!
With a fine of dollars that l guess you can't pay!
Tomorrow at you're seeing the judge And you think we're tough!
We'll make you more presentable for your court appearance.
Till then you can impress me by doing what you're told.
Clean him up.
Preston, go over there and hold the hose ready, OK?
Shit, take a look at that!
What the hell has he done?
Who cares?
Hands above your head and turn around.
God, we should tell Teasle about this.
Look at that!
You do what l tell you.
Galt, what the hell was that?
The boss said clean him up!
So clean him up!
Hey, Preston, give him a good hose behind the ears!
How d'you like that?
What's the matter, Mitch, don't you like water sports?
Hurry up, l need my coffee.
Sit down.
Real quiet.
Sit down!
Shit, he's hard to hold!
Forget the soap, Ward, he's tough.
Just shave him.
Dry!
Can't you see he's crazy?
Can't you see l don't care?
Yeah, l can.
That's better.
See, l knew that you......
We're just shaving you, easy now.
Hold him, Mitch.
Keep still.
l don't want to cut your throat.
You asshole!
What the hell....
l'll kill the asshole!
Art, don't shoot!
There are some people!
Get help!
l'll go after him!
Out of the way!
Son of a bitch!
Lester, it's Will.
l'm on to him.
He's driving east of Smith's farm, towards Chapman Creek.
l know you can hear me!
You're finished!
You won't get any further!
D'you hear me?
He's up there behind the hollow.
Mitch, get Orval on the radio.
Tell him to come with his dogs.
The Dobermen!
lt's gonna rain, they can hunt on sight.
Lester, tell Paul he should get the lumberjacks'helicopter.
lf they make any trouble he should book them for obstruction!
We'll get him.
No problem.
Go on, Hooch!
Get him, Thunder!
Go, babes!
We'll get him!
He'll soon be stuffed and on the wall.
We'll make a bearskin out of him.
Weren't we here last year for the deerhunt?
l shot some.
Mitch, up the hill!
Get these hounds away from me, Orval!
Move, they can run and eat at the same time!
He's going to the peak.
Smart.
lt's dangerous.
He's stupid!
Hey, you're messing up the trail.
Let my babes do their work!
This is no good.
Why?
We were three in a cell.
He beat us up.
Come on!
We've got him, he's trapped!
Art, he's heading for the ravine.
Head him off!
There he is!
On the cliff!
Asshole!
What's going on?
What are you doing?
We're just supposed to find him!
Hold it steady.
Won't work 'cos of the thermal draft.
He can't go anywhere!
lf you don't hold that thing steady, l swear, l'll kill you!
Sheriff to Galt!
Hold it steady, you asshole!
Galt, please come in, damn you!
Closer and hold still!
Galt, talk to me!
What's up?
There he is!
Over there, dummy!
Come on!
Hey, soldier boy!
Galt, go to the radio!
What's up?
l want him alive, Galt!
Art Galt, come in!
Helicopter, come, dammit!
Oh God, look!
My God, give me the binoculars!
Oh no!
Shit!
l don't understand.
How could he fall out?
ls that important?
Let's nail him!
Look!
Looks like he's turning himself in.
One man is dead.
lt's not my fault.
l don't want any more hurt.
Stop!
Stay there and give yourself up!
But l didn't do anything!
Move, and l'll blow your head off!
l didn't do anything!
Hold your fire!
Ward, hold your fire!
We hit him.
Let's go down, come on!
Sheriff to base, come in.
Yes, Will?
We're in the gorge.
Galt is dead.
Where's the goddam chopper?
lt's not coming, 'cos of the storm.
l don't give a fuck, l want the chopper!
l'm not leaving Galt's body here.
Oh, by the way, You're messing with some guy: John Rambo is a Vietnam veteran, belongs to the 'Green Berets', has the medal of honor and is a war hero.
That freak?
l knew there was something about him!
l checked it twice.
What shall l do?
Do what l told you: Get the chopper here, at once!
A Green Beret!
A war hero!
Great!
Just great!
Shut up!
What's up with you?
He's alone and wounded.
Those Green Berets are real hard guys!
So leave him to the state police.
Come here, boy!
Goddammit!
Look.
Look at him!
That's Art Galt, boy!
We were friends when your mother was still wiping your nose!
Now he's dead.
Because of that psychopath up there!
Now you listen good: l'm gonna get that bastard and pin that medal to his liver.
And l'm gonna do it with or without your help!
We're getting closer, scent's getting stronger.
Keep your eyes open.
Storm coming, that's all we need!
Will, let's go before it gets dark.
Afraid of the black man, you pansy?
l'll show you who's the pansy!
Stop it!
Ward, get away!
The fight's out here!
He's waiting for you Mitch, get up and get moving!
Find the guy, for Chrissakes!
And keep your eyes open!
See you later, Ward!
Shut up, Mitch.
There he is!
Let them go, Orval!
There's your dinner, sweethearts!
Hold fire!
l got hit, goddammit!
He's got a gun.
That's a damned scarecrow.
That was no scarecrow shooting.
He's here!
Kill him!
Get him!
Get him, Maggie!
Mitch, Ward, come here!
Shingleton, give us cover.
Look at his leg!
Mitch, make a tourniquet with your belt.
He needs a doctor!
Do it!
Where's the first-aid box?
l let it in the car.
Where did he get the gun?
From Galt.
Got no more bullets.
How d'you know?
The dog wasn't killed by a bullet.
Orval, listen.
You have to stay awake.
Release the tourniquet every minutes.
We'll get him.
He has no more bullets.
He shouldn't have kiled my sweetheart!
Get that son of a bitch!
OK, listen everyone.
We've got him.
We'll walk in one row, feet apart.
Don't stop, then he can't escape.
OK, the hunt is on.
Hunt?
We're not hunting him, he's hunting us!
Spread out, dammit!
l said feet apart!
l hate this!
Will, it's Mitch!
Who is it?
What's up here?
Shut up!
He's got Ward.
Spread out, l'll go this way.
Who's shooting there?
Who's shooting there?
l got him!
Shingleton, follow me!
l got him!
Help me!
Help me, Will!
Balford?
Where the hell are you?
Shingleton, over here!
Easy now.
Get me out of here!
Shingleton, where the hell are you?
l could have killed them all.
And you too.
ln town you're the law, here l am.
Don't push it.
Don't push it, or l'll give you a war you won't believe.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Get back, people!
How bad is the situation?
Captain...
That's the only positive thing about it, it's good for business.
The reporters are drinking the town dry.
Looks like you've had it.
Go home.
Now it's my problem.
Your problem?
Dave, don't give me that damned jurisdiction thing, OK?
Shall l go out?
Finish the job.
Somewhere on this mountain, probably above the snow line and surrounded by fog the fugitive, John Rambo, is hiding.
The state police and the national guard are being mobilized right now.
The local authorities have so far been unable to explain where the Ex Green Beret got the weapons he used to kill a deputy sheriff And wound others.
They only survived thanks to their police training.
They say the fugitive will be caught in the next few hours.
Your maps.
Will, there's something you should know.
Let's talk later.
What is it, Lester?
Spit it out!
l talked to Mitch.
Galt and the others must have treated the guy rough.
Assholes!
That doesn't change anything, Dave, and you know it!
lf one of the deputy sheriffs goes too far, the prisoner comes to me!
lf he's right l kick the deputy sheriff's ass!
l'm the law!
And that's how it should be.
lf you trample on the law, there's hell to pay!
Why does God create a man like Rambo?
God didn't create Rambo, lt was me.
Who are you?
Sam Trautman.
Colonel Samuel Trautman.
We have a lot to do.
What do you want?
l'm here because of my boy.
Your boy?
l recruited him, trained him and commanded him for years in Vietnam.
He belongs to me.
Why does the Pentagon send a colonel to sort things out?
The army thought l could help.
l don't know how.
Rambo is a civilian now, so he's my problem.
You don't understand.
l'm not here to save Rambo from you, But you from him.
Thanks for your concern, Colonel.
We'll take real care.
Amazing that some men survived!
Oh really?
Strictly speaking, he failed.
You were lucky!
Great!
So you're just here to see why your machine broke down?
You're dealing with an expert in guerilla warfare.
He's the best with a gun, a knife and his bare hands.
He was trained to ignore pain and the weather, and to eat things a goat would puke up.
ln Vietnam his job was to get rid of enemy personnel, to kill them.
Winning by attrition.
And Rambo was the best!
Now we're afraid, what do you and the special forces suggest We do with the psychopath?
Let him go.
What?
First for now.
Defuse the situation, defuse him.
Let him get away.
You'll soon find him in Seattle, working in a car wash.
That way no-one gets hurt.
l'll do my job myself, instead of praying they catch him in Seattle!
Your people are gonna get killed!
We hillbillies do our duty same as the heroes in the special forces.
We teach them to stay alive!
l never thought of that!
Do you want a war that you lose?
With men against one?
lf you're sending out so many people get in enough body-bags!
You just want to save your own ass, but whatever side you're on, lf you really want to get rid of Rambo, then follow me.
State police to John Rambo.
Acknowledge.
State police to John Rambo.
Come in please.
Acknowledge!
lf you're listening, Rambo, this is your situation: you're surrounded, Every escape route is blocked, all the highways, street and fire breaks.
Your services to your country will be taken into consideration.
Answer me, it can all be sorted out.
Please come in.
Anything?
He took a radio.
He's sure to be listening.
l would try to pick up something.
Sure he's listening!
But he never breaks radio silence.
Not for us, maybe for you.
He's your boy, ain't he?
Persuade him to spare us all and give himself up.
l can try.
We can get a bearing on him if you want to lay a trap for him.
That would be like taking the birds to the cat.
Thanks for sending your people.
You're welcome.
Put the magazine away and listen.
We'll only get one chance.
Troop leader to Raven.
Raven come in please.
Troop leader calling Raven.
Troop leader to Raven, talk to me, Johnny.
Troop leader calling the Baker Team: Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta, Jorgensen, Danforth, Berry, Krakauer.
Confirm.
Colonel Trautman speaking.
Talk to me, Johnny.
They're all gone, Sir.
There he is!
Go get him!
Rambo.
Are you OK?
All the Baker team are dead, Not Delmare Berry, he made it.
Berry too, sir.
How?
Caught his death in Vietnam, without knowing it.
Cancer ate him up.
l'm sorry, l didn't know that.
l'm the last one, sir.
lt's good to hear your voice, Johnny, it's been a long time.
You've done some damage here, but they don't want any trouble.
North-west.
That's why l'm here.
l'll fly you out of here.
Just you and me.
We'll work it out.
ls that an offer?
Where do you come from, Sir?
Bragg.
l called, but they could never find you in Bragg.
l'm hardly ever there, at the moment l'm sitting on my ass in Washington.
l wish l was in Bragg.
We'll talk about it when you come in.
l can't do that, Sir.
We can't allow you to kill friendly civilians.
There are no friendly civilians.
l'm your friend.
l was there, up to my knees in blood!
l've saved your ass many times.
Keeping you out of trouble is a life's work.
Without the fucking cops there wouldn't be any trouble!
l just wanted something to eat.
But the man provoked me, Sir.
You provoked them too, John.
They shot first, not me.
Let me get you out of here!
They shot first.
Do you still hear me?
Troop leader to Raven!
Rambo, acknowledge!
He's finished, Colonel We've got a bearing.
ln the morning l'll send all my men to the ridge.
We'll get him my way.
Dammit.
Dammit!
Go, move!
Does the guy have a gun?
The guy the cops are shooting at!
l see him!
l've got him!
Don't shoot!
This way!
Let's go!
There he is!
Come on!
Now we've got him!
Yeah, l know where that is.
Listen!
Surround the area, but don't go in.
Don't go in!
Wait till l'm there!
And don't shoot!
l want him alive!
Keep firing!
Go on, men, shoot!
Come on!
You're great!
Steve.
You and Bruce, you go round the trees to the mine entrance.
Screw you, Clinton, l'm not going!
Never.
Brandon, go into the mine.
No way.
What do you mean?
l'm not gonna get shot.
He's just waiting for that!
What's up with you, Clinton?
Rambo?
This is Lieutenant Clinton speaking!
National Guard leader.
l'll give you .
seconds to come on out.
Who's got the rocket launcher?
Me.
Come here, Earl.
This is your last chance!
Maybe we should wait.
The guy's a killer!
l'm in charge here and l say: blow him up!
Now fire that thing!
Just let me get out of the way first.
Give the man a cigar!
Bull's eye!
Where are you?
yards up the hill.
Get a little closer together.
l don't believe it!
ldiots!
One more for 'Soldier of Fortune'!
Do you think we're in a circus here?
Get going!
Clinton, for God's sake!
l ordered you to wait till l was there!
He shot at us!
l didn't want to take any risks.
What a mess.
We have to get the body out right away.
A bulldozer can't get up here, someone has to dig him out.
lt's your mess!
You dig!
l have to be back in the store tomorrow.
Then you'd better start now!
Buried in a hole by a bunch of weekend warriors!
He was your best guy?
lt doesn't matter how he ended, he was once something real special.
Nonsense!
He broke the law.
Vagrancy, right?
lt'll look great on his gravestone in Arlington: 'Here lies John Rambo, awarded the highest medal of honor.
survivor of countless missions in enemy territory, killed in a dump for vagrancy!' Cut the shit!
Rambo wasn't the only one who had it tough in Vietnam.
He killed a policeman!
He could have killed you all.
This guy!
Struts in here and tells us to let this nut go, to save our asses!
We did that, without letting him go!
The better guy lost!
And he doesn't like that!
How are you, Will?
Hold my calls.
Sit down.
Miss, another one, please.
Sure.
And for my friend...?
A short, 'wild turkey'.
lf l went too far earlier on l'd like to apologize.
That doesn't matter now, does it?
No, l guess not.
l think...
l just have the feeling...
You've been cheated out of your chance?
l wanted to kill the boy.
So much, that l could taste it.
Doesn't fit with the badge.
Things are sometimes confusing.
ln Vietnam it was pretty confusing for Rambo and me.
We had orders.
lf in doubt: kill!
But you're a civilian.
You're going back to your wife and your house.
You don't have to make sense out of all this.
How much sense did you make of it?
What would you have done with him?
Would you have given him a big hug Or blown his brains away?
To answer that l'd have to be standing in front of him.
There it is.
Just as well we'll never find out.
Drive!
Don't look at me, look at the road.
That's how accidents happen.
What's your name?
Cathcart, Robert A.
What's in the back, Robert A.?
M s OK, Robert, get out of the truck.
l don't want anything from you.Get!
Turn it up.
What's your story, Steamboat?
Someone cheered too soon.
That Rambo?
He's on the loose again.
Will, it's Rambo!
He's still alive!
Jesus Christ!
Get out.
Go on!
What's going on here?
Watch out!
They're all gonna blow!
Attention, all civilians!
For your own safety please clear the streets.
Stay in your houses and await instructions.
l repeat: This is a police emergency.
Clear the streets at once!
They found Rambo's body.
lt stole a truck and blew up a gas station.
The boy is tough.
Forget about it.
To hell with your advice!
Before, you knew he was still alive, didn't you?
l suspected it.
Sure, that's why you stayed here.
You trained him.
You taught him how to get out of a cave like that.
But he won't get out of this place.
You and your men were never a match for him.
So what's changed?
God knows what damage he'll do.
You're going to die, Teasle.
Everybody dies!
Only one of us has a chance and not because l'm better than him.
He trusts me.
l'm his only family, that gives me an advantage.
What sort of people are you?
lt's my job, Trautman, it's my town!
l'm not giving it up to you, Rambo or anyone else!
Keep out of my way!
Go nearer!
Don't go, lt's too hot!
Will, Lester here, d'you hear me?
Come, let's go!
Will, Lester here, d'you hear me?
We've got serious problems.
The highway is cut off.
The truck is here, but no body.
lt's burnt out.
Preston, send the people away!
Push them back to the south side.
We don't know how many gas tanks there are under the pumps...
Go on, go!
You crazy asshole!
Rambo!
Rambo, don't do it!
Listen to me!
You've got no chance.
Put your gun down.
A chopper will fly you to Bragg.
Cease fire!
Yeah?
Cease fire!
Think what you're doing.
The building is surrounded.
There's no way out.
There are men outside with M s!
You helped cause this private war.
You've done enough damage!
The mission is over, understood?
The mission is over!
Look at them outside.
Look at them!
End it, or they'll kill you.
Do you want that?
lt's over, Johnny.
lt's over!
Nothing is over!
Nothing!
You can't just switch it off!
lt wasn't my war.
You asked me, l didn't ask you!
l did everything to win, but someone didn't let us win.
And at home at the airport those maggots were protesting.
They spat at me, called me a baby murderer and shit like that!
Why protest against me, when they weren't there, didn't experience it?
lt was hard, but it's in the past.
For you!
Civilian life means nothing to me.
There we had a code of honor.
You watch my back, l watch yours.
Here there's nothing!
You're the last of an elite troop, don't end it like this.
There l flew helicopters, drove tanks, had equipment worth millions.
Here l can't even work parking!
Where is everybody?
l had a friend who was there for us.
There were all these guys.
There were all these great guys!
My friends!
Here there's nothing!
D'you remember Dan Forest?
He wore a black headband.
He had found magic markers, That he sent to Las Vegas, because we'd always talked about that.
About the Chevy Convertible we wanted to drive until the tires fell off.
ln one of these barns a kid came to us with a kind of shoe cleaning box.
'Shine?' He kept on asking.
Joe said yes.
l went to get a couple of beers.
The box was wired.
He opened it...
There were body parts flying everywhere.
He lay there and screamed...
l have all these pieces of him on me!
Just like that.
l try to get him off me, my friend!
l'm covered with him!
Blood everywhere and so...
l try to hold him together, But the entrails keep coming out!
And nobody would help!
He just said: 'l want to go home!'And called my name.
'l want to go home, Johnny!
l want to drive my Chevy!
But l couldn't find his legs.
'l can't find your legs!' l can't get it out of my head.
lt's seven years ago.
l see it every day.
Sometimes l wake up and don't know where l am.
l don't talk to anyone.
Sometimes all day long.
Sometimes a week.
but I believe we can ill afford to lose men of your high character.
And speaking as a friend...
who's fought side by side with you for years...
I will sorely miss the unshakable support...
you've given the Royal Hong Kong Police.
So, on behalf of all Brits...
who have ever carried the shield in Hong Kong we shall miss you.
We wish you nothing but happiness...
as you take up your new post in the United States.
Ladies and gentlemen, Consul Han.
Thank you, Thomas.
You know Thomas is not going to make this evening easy.
Excuse me.
Commander Griffin...
I am pleased to be able to leave you and Hong Kong...
with a special gift tonight.
Earlier this evening, Detective lnspector Lee...
and his special task force have once and for all...
crushed the Juntao criminal organization...
and reclaimed artifacts from years of China's heritage.
This is the kind of legacy I dreamt about.
-Hong Kong forever.
-To Hong Kong forever.
Stupid fool!
Get out of my way!
Man, are you crazy?
Shoot!
-Clive, what's up, man?
-You're late.
-I'm late?
-Yeah, you're late.
I've been waiting in the back for over an hour.
-I was in the diner.
-Think I would do this shit out front?
-I'm gonna get busted.
-You weren't in the diner.
It don't even matter.
Let's do this.
What's that, a gun?
Stop it, man.
Let's do it.
Come on.
-Don't be late again.
-I ain't gonna be late.
What we got?
That's tight.
That's beautiful.
-That's nice.
What's that?
-That's C .
-Oh, shit.
-What's the problem?
No problem.
I been looking everything for this shit.
How the hell you find some C?
The lraqis can't even get this shit.
Where'd you get this from?
It's a hot ticket.
You don't know how happy you made me.
You got what I want.
Let me get that money.
-Step away from the car.
-Hey, officers.
Put your hands above your heads.
Just do it now.
Ain't no problem here.
Why y'all messing with us for?
All right, take it easy, buddy.
You don't wanna do that.
-No, he don't.
He's playing.
-No, I ain't playing.
-Yes, he is, officer.
-I'm not playing!
-Drop the gun!
-He's my cousin.
We're just talking.
-Get in your car and leave.
-We can't do that.
I'Il blow his head all over the parking lot.
-Go away and buy some doughnuts!
-You made him mad.
Let me talk to him.
All right?
-Don't move!
-Everything's cool now.
He down.
The gun's down.
Get back in the car and leave.
-Hands in your head!
-Everything's cool, officer.
Do it now!
Didn't I tell you?
Stop it!
I got C in the trunk!
Clive, guess what, man.
I forgot to tell you.
I'm LAPD.
You under arrest.
Excuse me.
-What?
-Telephone.
China.
Soo Yung, I love you.
Have a nice day.
Will you be home after school?
I am going to pick you up myself.
-Is there a problem, officer?
-No problem.
Just rush hour.
Security's in place?
You're sure all ofthe exhibits will be ready by this weekend?
Yes, sir.
Your opening remarks are scheduled for : .
Excuse me, Consul Han.
I'm Warren Russ with the FBl.
This is Agent Whitney.
We need to speak with you in private.
Excuse me.
I know this is a difficult time for you, Consul...
but we'Il get your daughter back.
But will you get her back alive?
We have the best agents in the world on those streets.
I would like one of my people to help.
Let me assure you, the FBI considers this a top priority.
We have plenty of people on the case.
Mr Russ, I am not an American.
My daughter is not an American.
-I understand that, sir...
-He's already on the plane.
I trust you will treat him with the same courtesy as you have shown me.
Ten people jumped out ofthe trunk.
I started handling all ofthem.
Throwing them everywhere.
Ten two stupid cops came out of nowhere...
messed everything up, but then I regrouped.
It ain't in there.
Anyway, I saved their life.
I start runnin', trying to get the bomb...
-I can't believe you went without me.
-I'Il talk to y'all later, all right?
I'Il tell you the best part after work.
This is why nobody will work with you...
why you're the only cop in the department without a partner.
Johnson, look, first of all, ifyou want a date with me...
you have to wait on the list like every other woman, OK?
Second of all, I work alone.
I don't need no partner and ain't never gonna have one.
-Did Kojak have a partner?
-Yeah.
The fat guy.
He wasn't never with him.
Did Columbo?
Captain Diel ordered me to go with you...
you needed bomb squad backup, but once again you screwed me and yourself.
Look, Johnson, it's dangerous out there.
It's safer for you to be behind the desk.
We were supposed to be on the same team.
This is LAPD, the most hated cops in the free world.
My own mama ashamed of me.
She tell everybody l'm a drug dealer.
This is a pit stop for me.
I'm on the verge of leaving you suckers behind.
Actually, you're on the verge of being suspended.
Have a nice day.
Somebody told you I was being suspended?
Quit playin', girl.
I know you playin'.
Somebody told you I was being suspended?
This is a problem.
That's all I needed.
Some foreigner...
getting his head blown off and creating an international incident.
What can we do?
He's on the his way.
Call the field office.
Have them send over a rookie.
We'Il have him escort this guy around a few days...
pretend to follow some leads, keep him out of our way.
You want to do that to one ofthe men?
What do you suggest?
Well, as long as we're gonna humiliate someone...
might as well be LAPD.
Even if I had an extra man who would want such a bullshit assignment?
Well, it's a disgrace to me.
A disgrace to my department.
It's a disgrace to...
Dan, l'm sending someone right over.
Captain, I know you read the paper, but they lying.
I wouldn't do anything like that.
Theyjust want a story.
Two officers were shot.
One man lost a pinkie.
-But nobody died.
-You destroyed half a block.
-That block was messed up.
-You lost lots of evidence.
We got a little left.
What you did was dangerous and completely against policy.
And not only that...
you did a good job.
What?
Everyone around here is so image-conscious.
So afraid oftheir own goddamn shadow.
It's nice to meet a detective who's willing to lay it on the line.
Captain, that's the same way I feel.
Every so often, we have to let the general public know...
-that we can still blow shit up.
-That's the only way I work.
So that mean I ain't getting suspended?
-Are you kidding?
-Don't know why I said that.
I just got a call from the FBl.
The -year-old daughter of a Chinese diplomat...
was kidnapped this morning, and they want you on the case.
-FBI want me?
-That's right.
-Stop lying.
-I don't lie.
-Tell the truth.
-I'm telling the truth.
Thank you, Captain.
Congratulations, Carter.
You are going to the show.
I'Il look out for you when I reach the top.
-I'Il make you mayor.
-I'd rather you didn't.
Hey, listen up!
lf anybody need me...
I'm gonna be working a big, big case for the FBl!
Yo.
Take care ofthat for me.
I need one ofthose earpieces immediately, all right?
Hey, how you doin'?
I want the consul's personnel records cross-checked...
with that new list we received from lnterpol.
See ifyou can make any matches or connections.
OK, boys, what have we got?
Have you checked the consul personnel records yet?
I want to know who's he been talking with.
OK, come on.
Give me the story.
Any demands?
Any fingerprints?
Whitney, who's this?
Give me a copy ofthat.
James Carter, FBl.
Warren, he's here for the special assignment.
I'm Agent in charge Warren Russ.
It's good to have you aboard.
I waited a long time for this.
You guys sure take a long time to process an application.
Well, Carter, your particular assignment is considered G classified.
Why don't you and I take a walk and l'Il fill you in?
G classified.
That's good.
You don't understand.
This is my dream.
I'm very excited about working with the FBl.
I'm glad.
Listen, his name is Lee.
And the director considers this a top priority.
But he's gonna get in my way.
I'm not used to having a partner.
If l'm handling the situation, l'm gonna have to work alone.
He is the situation.
Must be a misunderstanding.
I was sent down here for the kidnapping.
Little girl?
Forget the little girl.
Your assignment is Lee.
Who is Lee and what kind of assignment is that?
Lee is a foreign detective and a friend ofthe consul's.
It's yourjob to keep him out of sight and away from danger.
You want me to baby-sit, but I don't do that.
I came down here for the big assignment.
This is an FBI operation and I don't need any help from LAPD...
or some Chun-King cop.
You got it?
Whoa.
Hold it.
Why not use your men for this top priority case?
What am I supposed to do, take him to the zoo?
I don't give a damn.
I don't want to see him or you till this is resolved.
His plane arrives in one hour.
We want to make a good impression.
It's his first trip to America.
This is bullshit!
Please tell me you speak English.
I'm Detective Carter!
Do you speak any English?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
I cannot believe this shit!
First, I get a bullshit assignment, now, Mr Rice-a-Roni...
don't even speak American.
Come on.
My ride's over here.
Put your bag in the back.
Put your bag in the back!
You put your own shit in the back!
I am not a skycap.
I'm FBl, you understand?
What the hell you think this is?
Captain, I don't think this is funny.
No, l'm serious, Captain.
Tell the FBI you made a mistake.
I can't do that.
I'm sure that you and Mr Lee will have a nice time together.
You better call the FBI or I drop his ass at Panda Express.
Drop this case, you're suspended for two months without pay.
You can forget about being mayor then.
Congratulations, Carter.
Looks like you finally got yourself a partner.
One little pinkie get blowed off and everybody trippin'.
Chinese consul?
That's one place you can't go.
I ain't getting fired.
You gonna pay my bills?
That's the little girl?
Say something.
Y'all think this is real funny.
Give Carter the big G classified case.
Gonna show the FBI they don't know who they are playing with.
I'Il solve this case myself.
That's right.
But I wanna show you something first.
Look familiar?
Just like home, ain't it?
I ain't never been to China, but it probably look like this.
Get your star maps!
Look, John Wayne.
You know John Wayne?
Yeah, man.
Hang out with the Duke.
I'Il be right back.
You might see one ofyour cousins here.
Right here!
Star maps!
You got the address to Michael Jackson's house?
You can't come around myjob.
That's harassment.
I'm just checking up on you.
I'm fully legit now.
I'm selling star maps.
Legit my ass.
You and your Asian gang friends know about a kidnapping?
I don't know nothing.
Give me one ofthem star maps...
for $ you understand what l'm saying?
Don't know nothin' about no kidnapping...
but this dude's buying firearms, explosives, and people...
-Iike he's gonna start a war.
-What's his name?
-For $ I don't know his name.
-You better tell me something.
-I don't know nothing for $ .
-Stucky, you don't...
I didn't tell you nothing!
Didn't I tell you to wait for me?
What the hell you doing on this bus?
Think l'm playing with you?
I ain't playing with you.
Sit down.
All right.
It's OK.
It's all right.
FBl.
Take a picture.
Wait a minute.
What?
Get out of my way!
FBl.
Stop this bus.
Hey, look.
Hey, kids, get back in here.
Sit down.
Stop!
FBl!
I need this motorcycle.
-No way, man.
-Get off!
Get out ofthe car!
Get out ofthe car now!
Where you think you're going?
Didn't I say to stay by the Duke?
-What do you think you're doing?
-Mind your own business.
Hey.
What you doing?
You thought I was gonna shoot you?
What's happening here?
Put the gun down.
I ain't playing with you!
-Think l'm playing with you?
-Don't move!
Drop your guns.
-Look.
FBl.
-I'm policeman.
I'm just showing him to take a gun from a suspect.
All of a sudden you speaking English?
-A little.
-My ass.
You lied to me.
I didn't say I didn't.
You assumed so.
Assume I kick you little Beijing ass right now.
I know you know that tricky shit.
I'm not responsible for your assumptions.
You full of shit, you understand that?
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.
You seem as ifyou like to talk.
I let people talk who like to talk.
It makes easier to find out how full of shit they are.
What the hell did you just say?
I like people to talk...
-So l'm the one full of shit?
-We both full of shit.
You full of shit.
I'm gonna kick your ass.
Don't nobody do that but me.
You want me to kick your ass, don't you?
You must take me to see Consul Han right away.
Just sit there and shut up.
This ain't no democracy.
-Yes, it is.
-No, it ain't.
This is the United States of James Carter now.
I'm the president, l'm the emperor, l'm the king.
I'm Michael Jackson, you Tito.
Your ass belong to me.
Why would they not want my help?
'Cause they don't give a damn about you.
They don't like you.
I don't like you.
I don't care.
I'm here for the girl.
The girl don't like you.
Nobody likes you.
You came all the way over here for nothing.
You ain't gonna be...
Beach Boys.
Oh, hell, no.
You didn't just touch my goddamn radio.
The Beach Boys are great American music.
The Beach Boys will get you a great ass-whoopin'.
Don't ever touch a black man's radio, boy.
You can do that in China but you'Il get your ass killed out here.
Let me show you real music.
That's real music.
You hear that?
Now can you do that to the Beach Boys?
Hell no!
I must get to the consulate.
What are we doing here?
It's called a shakedown.
Very serious police work.
Just watch me handle my business and patrol this place.
I want to help with the investigation.
This is my case.
Your case?
Look, you can back me up.
When we get in here, follow my lead and do what I do.
What's up, my nigger?
-Is this weed?
-What?
You got a prescription for this?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where?
-I should take your ass to jail.
-For what?
-Look at this!
-That's nothing but a cigarette.
-This ciga-weed!
-Well, it look like cigarette.
-You better have glaucoma.
-I do.
What's up, my nigger?
Check that, baby.
What's happening, Carter?
Put the guns down.
M.C.Hammer there, put the goddamn gun down.
I got some questions, and I need some answers.
-Put'em down.
-Where the girl?
-What girl?
-The little girl.
-What little girl?
-The Chinese girl.
I don't know nothin' about no Chinese girl.
I'Il take your asses in if I don't get answers.
-Carter, put the gun down.
-Don't act like you know me.
I see what's going on here.
You trying to play me like a fool.
Lee, go outside real quick.
It's gonna get a little dangerous in here.
-I may have quest...
-Lee, go and wait by the bar.
-I'Il take care of everything.
-You sure?
I'm sure.
Go on now.
Think l'm playing?
Hurry up!
Don't come in my business scaring me like that.
I was just playing.
Man, give me a hug.
Just schooling the rookie, showing him the ropes.
Why you didn't come to church Sunday?
I had some things to take care of.
But I made the night service.
Come here, I wanna holler at you.
Who's this guy buying up these explosives and weapons?
I don't know nothing about that.
Luke, I know what you do.
The only reason why I ain't busted your ass...
'cause you my cousin, and it'd kill Aunt Bootsy.
-Why you put Aunt Bootsy in this?
-I ain't playing.
I know she got a bad heart, but I will bust your ass.
Tell me something.
The word down in Chinatown is there's this new dude in town.
Bad-ass dude outta Hong Kong buying up every goddamn thing.
-What's his name?
-Don't know.
-He ain't buying shit from me.
-You don't know his name?
Don't nobody know his name.
What's up, my nigger?
What did you just say?
What's up, my nigger?
Come here!
You better watch your mouth!
-What you say, boy?
-I don't want trouble.
Please...
I said I don't want trouble.
That's bad for you.
-Where the little girl at?
-What little girl?
You know what girl l'm talking about.
Man, you better take your goddamn hands off my suit.
Your mama bought me this suit for Christmas.
I'Il see you Thanksgiving.
Appreciate it.
Get your big Happy-Meal ass over.
Get over in the corner!
l'm still the law around here!
Next time I come here, y'all better clean this up!
And brush your teeth!
Let's go.
-What are we doing here?
-I'm getting something to eat.
You want anything, like a Cup O'Noodles?
Stop wasting my time.
I made a promise to Soo Yung.
You're right.
I have been wasting your time.
I'm sorry.
Just let me go get something to eat.
When I come back out, l'Il take you wherever you want to go.
Shake on it?
What are you doing?
You ain't the only one with quick hands, are you?
I'Il be right back.
I got you a beef-and-bean burrito.
We have a taxicab approaching.
A man stepping out.
Asian.
We've got someone approaching the gate.
Dropped off by a cab.
-Tell them to intercept.
-Intercept.
We will intercept.
-Can I help you?
-Yes.
I must see the consul.
-About what?
-Please, it's very important.
Why don't you tell us why you need to see the consul?
We'Il tell you whether it is important.
Do you have identification?
-It's about his daughter Soo Yung.
-Hands above your head!
-He asked about the consul's daughter.
-He asked about the daughter.
You don't understand.
I was invited.
Don't move!
Throw your gun away.
-He's gonna kill them.
-Is everything all right?
You'Il be safer on the second floor.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about this.
He went over.
Stay away from the window, please.
Right here.
Get down!
Now!
Don't move!
I think there has been a misunderstanding.
It's all right.
It's OK.
It's him.
The guy from China.
-What?
-Come in, please.
Mr Russ, I would like you to meet Detective lnspector Lee.
Excuse me very much.
Your gun.
Where the hell is Carter?
Then I gotta put up with this.
See a little Asian dude about this height...
with a steering wheel on his arm?
Go screw yourself.
-What you say?
-I said go screw yourself.
You take your sensitive ass up there and let me in!
Don't make me get up out ofthis truck!
Man, when I get up in here, l'm slapping somebody.
What happened, Carter?
I ain't supposed to be jumping on buses!
I do not do that.
I am not Carl Lewis.
Who is this man?
Sir, I can explain.
Agent Carter has been helping with my investigation.
He's upset that we have not done ourjob.
Me and Lee are taking care ofthe situation.
We have everything under control.
We'Il get your daughter back safe and sound.
He is very passionate about finding your daughter.
Well, I owe you my gratitude.
We wanted Detective Lee to have one of our best men by his side.
Maybe this is a good time to tell him the details of my assignment.
Can I speak to you for a moment?
You wanna speak to me?
For a moment?
ln private?
Oh, I see!
This must be G classified.
FBl-type stuff.
Let me call my captain and let him know what's going on.
We'Il talk in a second.
When a G comes around.
-Who's this?
Hello?
-Am I speaking with FBl?
-Give me the phone.
-Yeah, this is the FBl.
-You are FBl?
-Yeah, this is the FBl.
Ifyou want the gnrl back alnve, lnsten and do not talk.
OK, l'm listening.
Let me get a pen.
All right.
Cool.
The drop will be made tonight.
: p.m.
The amount will be $ million.
Fifty million dollars?
Who you think you kidnapped, Chelsea Clinton?
Keep him talking.
-In used currency.
Nothnng bngger than a .
All right.
Cool.
Fifty million.
No problem.
I want million in s...
Twenty million in s.
Twenty million in s...
-Twenty million in s.
-And mnllnon nn s.
And million in s.
You want any fries with that?
What is your name?
You called us.
Why you want to know my name?
I just want to be able to tell the consul who's responsible...
for his daughter's death because he talks too much.
All right, hold up.
Calm down.
I'm trying to hook you up.
I'm on your side.
You will receive instruction for the drop...
half an hour before it is to be made.
If it is successful, the girl will live.
I'm gonna make sure you get the money...
and we can spend it together when you do...
'cause I don't even really work for them.
We got it.
South Broadway.
Downtown.
Team one, proceed down to th and Broadway.
Team two, I want you around the back on th and Main.
Set up a perimeter.
Take your team and cover the building all the way to the top.
Move.
They must not go into the building.
Yeah, you right.
Let's go tell them.
Come on.
Mr Russ, you must pull your men back.
What the hell are you doing here?
Where's Carter?
Please, listen to me.
You may be very competent but the mere fact...
that you know this girl compromises yourjudgment.
Sir, ifyou were asking for $ million...
would you be in a place like that?
Get this clown away from me.
Take a hike!
-Why were you hiding?
-What you talking about?
-You were hiding.
-I bent down to tie my shoe.
Sir, the area is secured.
-Room's empty.
-Damn it!
-Everybody pull back!
-Goddamn!
Get some paramedics down here now!
Evacuate the building right away!
Get fire crews here!
We got an explosion at th and Broadway.
That ain't far enough, man!
I ain't Kareen Abdul-Jabbar!
Push it down some more!
Carter, don't come any...
stop!
What the hell...
I think I done broke my shit.
Who was that you was chasing?
His name is Sang from Hong Kong.
Because ofyou he got away.
Why you ain't tell me about the bridge?
-I did.
-No, you didn't.
I said stop.
I don't understand what you be saying.
What?
You see what l'm saying?
-What's this in your hand?
-He dropped it.
Oh, shit.
Come on.
-Where are we going?
-I messed up my suit.
Fifteen seconds.
Make a decision.
Oh, shit!
Did I come at a bad time?
I got bad news for you, Johnson.
We're all dead.
I was distracted, sir.
Distractions can occur in the field.
That's why we call this practice.
Ifyou can't handle the pressure, then quit.
Man, give her a break.
Don't worry about him.
How you doing, girl?
Give me some love.
-Why are you tormenting me?
-That any way to treat an old friend?
I came to see how you was doing, and I need some help.
Help?
I know that you have strong feelings for me...
but we gotta put that aside.
It's a little girl's life at stake here.
Since when do you care about anybody but yourself?
Please, just take a look at this.
We found this on a kidnapper.
Tell me what this is.
You want me to work with you?
I don't have time for this.
I got my own shit to deal with.
-Who are you?
-Sorry we got you in trouble.
Yeah, he's sorry.
Tell me something about this I don't know.
A remote.
Could be nitro cap, could be cross-delayed...
definitely not homemade, definitely not American.
I could open up a garage door, or blow up some C .
C?
Yeah, C .
This means so much to me.
Hey, and l'm sorry about spreading all those rumors...
on Christmas about us sleeping together.
-What?
-He's just joking.
Hey, Bobby, what's up, man?
-I need to see Clive Cod.
-No way, Carter.
It's lights out.
You want me to lose myjob?
I got you this damn job.
You better let me in here.
Can't do it.
Didn't I turn my back when you bought that bag ofweed?
I was splitting it with you.
Didn't I give you the bigger half?
Do me this favor.
Shit.
You got five minutes.
Hey, Cod.
Your two brothers are here to see you.
Clive, how you doing, man?
You got a lot of balls, coming here.
I was just around the way.
Figured you would be bored.
-I came to see how you was doing.
-What the hell do you want?
I just came to bring you a gift.
I know you got time to kill.
I brought you a toy.
-I don't want that.
-You don't?
Somebody told me you like this stuff.
I don't like stuff like that.
I don't even know what it is.
You never sold this to nobody?
How could l, when I don't know what it is?
-Hold it.
-I don't want to hold it.
-Just touch it.
-I don't want to touch it.
-You scared of it?
-You think l'm stupid?
-Stupid enough to get busted.
-You want my fingerprints, to frame me.
Why would I do something like that?
Think I would try tricking you again?
I don't have to frame you.
You'Il do life for killing the little girl.
I don't know anything about a little girl.
That ain't what l'Il tell everybody.
-I don't know anything.
-I got a big mouth, Clive.
Let me tell you something.
I don't know anything about that...
so you can kiss my fat ass.
It'd take me all day to kiss your fat ass.
You want some ofthis?
l'Il give you all you want.
-Give me a name.
-I ain't telling you shit.
She's only years old.
I don't want her to die.
Look at the picture.
I don't care about him or you.
I care about the little girl.
Give me the name.
The guy's name is Juntao.
I never seen him.
-Where can I find him?
-Foo Chow Restaurant.
Chinatown.
Get rid ofthis guy.
He'Il get you killed.
Clive, thank you, man.
I'm gonna come back.
I'm gonna bring your fat ass some cookies.
That's it right there.
What are we waiting for?
We scoping the place out, man.
Ain't gonna run up in there.
I'm falling asleep.
-You don't know anything about no war.
-Everybody knows war.
It ain't you all, it's y'all.
Man, you sound like a karate movie.
Y'all!
Say it from right here with some soul.
Y'all.
Let me show your goofy ass how to do this.
Come on, come on.
Do that again.
Do it again.
Like this.
One will be inserted into the suitcase.
The other will be on you.
When you make the drop...
-Do we have it?
-All right, pick it up.
-You have what I asked for?
-I do.

-Is it good?
-Very good.

-Camel's hump.
Kinda good.
Need a little hot sauce, but it's kinda good, though.
We still waiting?
How we gonna get Juntao?
How we know he exists?
Ain't nobody seen him.
I know.
He killed my partner.
I'm sorry about that, man.
That's why I have no partner.
I learned that from my daddy.
-Your daddy was a policeman?
-Fifteen years LAPD.
-My father was also a policeman.
-Your daddy was a cop?
Not a cop, an officer.
A legend all over Hong Kong.
My daddy a legend, too.
All over America.
My daddy once arrested people in one night by himself.
My daddy arrested by himself.
My daddy saved five crackheads from a burning building by himself.
My daddy once caught a bullet with his bare hands.
My daddy'Il kick your daddy's ass all the way from here to China...
or Japan or wherever you from.
All up that Great Wall, too.
-Don't talk about my father.
-Don't talk about my daddy.
-Hey, that your boy?
-Yes, let's go.
I better go in first.
Ain't nobody gonna recognize me.
I'Il wait five minutes.
Hey, you take my ID.
If anything go wrong, you bust in like you're LAPD.
This won't work.
I'm not '.
Yes, it will work.
It's all about attitude.
Flip it open, flip it closed.
Do it fast.
Open, close.
Fast.
You'Il get it.
Look.
Take this.
Hey, man, act like you're from out oftown.
-I am from out oftown.
-Don't act like a cop.
Like a tourist.
-Don't be so obvious.
All right.
-OK, no problem.
-How you doing?
-For one?
No, for two.
I'm here for a meeting with Mr Juntao.
I'm sorry.
I don't know Mr Juntao.
Maybe you don't understand.
I'm Mr Juntao's legal advisor.
He got into some shit again.
I'm a very busy man.
I ain't got time to be coming down here.
My wife wants me to come home, baby's shitting all over.
Would you please get Mr Juntao?
But I have already told you I don't know...
You think I came here for nothing?
You gonna give me gas money?
Would you please go tell Mr Juntao to get his ass here?
Thank you.
Can I sit here?
Right here?
Thank you.
-Y'all got any eel?
-Sure.
How's your camel hump?
Excuse me?
Where is Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles?
This way?
I'm sorry.
I'm from out oftown.
-Thank you.
-Welcome.
What's that?
No, wait.
Get the girl out of here.
Make sure those two don't leave.
-Juntao will see you.
-It's about time.
Stop it!
Let me go!
This is tight.
Ain't nothing like downstairs.
What's up, man?
What y'all watching?
Where Juntao at?
Why y'all so quiet?
That was childish, man.
That wasn't even called for!
Now I came down here to see Juntao...
'cause he told me to come down here...
'cause l'm his half-brother from Beijing.
Me and him got the same mama.
I'm Blackinese.
We all the same.
Whoa.
Wait a minute.
OK, you gonna kill me?
OK, put the gun down, fight like a man.
Fight me like a man.
Shit!
Anybody can shoot somebody.
That's what l'm talking about.
Back.
Give me some room.
You don't know who you messing with.
I'm gonna knock that yellow...
-Which one ofy'all kicked me?
-Me.
OK.
All right.
Hold on.
Let's talk about this.
Let's talk about this, man.
No, no.
What that mean?
This is a misunderstanding.
Come on, let's pray about this.
-FBl, huh?
-No, I ain't FBl.
I'm a security guard, I work at the mall.
Now wipe yourself off.
You're bleeding.
Oh, hell no.
He just playing.
He ain't mean that.
He meant cut me loose.
Let me go.
LAPD.
Watch out!
Behind you.
Freeze!
We kicked y'all ass.
All y'all.
Y'all got your ass kicked.
I'm gonna kill your ass.
Lee!
Over here, man!
Is that my gun?
-It is my gun.
-Let's go.
Why you gotta drop the goddamn badge?
Then you threw the gun out ofthe window.
Come on, this way.
I got everything under control.
Don't worry about nothing.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
It's cool.
Why am I not surprised to find you here, Carter?
Dan, I want these two back at the consulate immediately.
Let's take a ride, gentlemen.
You better get your hand off me.
Hey, man, he with me.
Just let me explain.
I'Il start from the top.
We were making the drop.
Han was about to get her back...
and you two screwed it up.
What you talking about?
Didn't you hear what Lee said?
Mr Lee is on his way to Hong Kong.
Now get out of here...
before I file obstruction charges against you.
We was about to solve the case.
All we need to do...
You're no longer on this assignment, Carter.
Case closed.
-Consul Han!
-Sorry, sir.
It was all my fault.
Lee would never do anything to jeopardize your daughter's life.
He loves your daughter.
It's a little too late for apologies.
Consul...
you have a call.
We're ready.
Pick it up.
The ransom is now million.
I will call with instructions.
You deliver the money or pick up the body ofyour daughter.
Please.
You must understand.
What happened tonight was not...
Soo Yung, please tell them I wnll do whatever...
Sorry, man.
Be sorry for Soo Yung.
No hard leads.
None.
Listen, we're doing all we can here, all right?
Tracing everything that's coming into this compound.
Excuse me, Consul.
You have a guest.
Jack, let me get back to you.
I'm sorry, my friend.
I couldn't stand by and do nothing.
Hey!
What's up, baby?
Man, you got guts calling me.
I'm gonna hang up.
Hey, wait a minute.
Don't hang up.
You know what?
You was right about me.
I'm sorry.
-Are you in drugs?
-You was rnght.
I was egotistic.
I was inconsiderate.
I was self-centered.
I ain't used to working with partners...
but it ain't about me.
It's about the little girl.
She gonna die without our help.
You understand what l'm saynng?
Not yet, but keep talking.
I think something big going down tonight, all right?
I need to find out where the consul's gonna be.
You thnnkyou can help me?
-I'Il see what I can do.
-No.
I don't need you to see.
I need you to do it.
Can you do it?
OK, Carter.
One other thing.
What color panties you got on?
Consul Han, I wantyou to go to the Chnnese expo as you planned.
Have the money nn the upstanrs control room.
Be sure to make no more mnstakes.
I understand that, but I want to speak with my daughter!
Excuse me, miss.
Who's the captain on this plane?
Look, it don't even matter.
You need to go up there...
tell the captain we got a problem on the left side.
Something wrong with the engine.
You need a new alternator.
My supervisor said, 'Willy, go on down there and fix that plane.
Don't let it leave till I come down there.' I suggest you tell the proper authorities...
not to move this plane before the FAA come here...
Go on!
-What are you doing here?
-Get your ass up.
We got work to do.
-Go away.
I've disgraced myself.
-Lee, what about the little girl?
Leave me alone.
A man like you could never understand.
-A man like me?
-Devoted only to yourself.
You're ashamed of being an officer.
You dishonor your father's name.
You don't know anything about my father.
-You say your father is a legend.
-My father was a legend.
He was killed making a routine traffic stop in daylight...
by some punk who didn't want no ticket...
when his partner was to get out of the car and back him up, he didn't.
My father was as devoted as you, and now he's dead.
For a traffic ticker and some punk?
What's the honor in that?
You believe your father wasted his life, died for nothing?
Prove me wrong.
For years until China resumed control of Hong Kong...
Juntao was the most powerful crime lord in Southeast Asia.
The British tried to close down his operation, but we failed.
But why the consul's daughter?
Detective lnspector Lee help me raid...
every known asset of Juntao's operation.
We confiscated millions in weapons and cash...
and a collection of Chinese art unsurpassed in the world.
Then Juntao disappeared.
No witnesses.
Do you really think he'Il kill the girl?
My advice to you is...
pay the money.
Consul, l'm going upstairs to make the drop.
I want you to remain calm as if nothing's wrong...
and don't leave Agent Whitney's side even for a moment.
I understand.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Consul Han.
On behalf ofthe People's Republic of China, thank you for coming.
I am pleased to present .
years of Chinese history and heritage...
a collection which, until recently, was thought to be lost forever.
This some nice shit.
That Buddha'd go good in my bathroom.
This is the history of my country...
priceless pieces of Chinese culture.
If anything gets damaged...
Ain't nothing gonna happen to none ofthis stuff.
And now we can pass them on to our children.
Pardon me.
I seen that guy at the Chinese restaurant.
Consul Han has been fighting flu for the past few days...
so perhaps I should finish what he started.
The first thing we gotta do is clear out this riffraff.
If anybody stay behind, they got something to lose.
I'Il be right back.
...future between our two countries.
The more we see the differences...
-Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
-Goddamn it.
-I'm Detective Carter from the LAPD.
-Russ, we got Carter down here.
-What the hell's going on?
-We have just received...
a threat on the building.
Please exit the building...
as soon as possible, and please do not panic.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Get your shit and go out!
There's a bomb in the building!
I don't believe this.
Agents, hold your positions!
Everybody take care, but hold your positions.
Get your old ass out the building!
Woman, the exit over there.
Gonna get your head blowed off!
Titty, titty...
Get them titties outta here.
Will somebody grab Carter?
Consul Han, six blocks of C are wired to your daughter in a car outside.
Before the changeover, most ofthis exhibition...
was in the hands of a single private collector.
Me.
I worked most of my life to acquire and catalog...
these priceless pieces that you see before you.
And then, in one fell swoop, it was taken away from me.
But tonight, I shall be paid in full.
Don't move.
She dies if I press this button.
Just be patient.
My transportation will be here shortly.
Stay calm.
I was just gonna tell you you was in a read zone.
You didn't know I could do that.
Put your hands up!
I ain't gonna kill you this time.
I'm just gonna kick your ass!
You tell your friends about me.
Hey, how you doing?
We've been looking for you.
I'm Detective Carter, LAPD.
Everything is OK now.
I'Il take you to your daddy.
And first thing l'm gonna do is take this vest offyou.
-Don't touch it!
-It'Il be safer ifwe take it off.
No.
I heard them say it will explode.
I think it'Il be safer ifwe leave it on.
Don't move.
Where are you?
-Don't move!
-Hold your positions, goddamn it!
Do not draw your weapons.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I think we'Il call that an evening.
Thank you and good night.
I got something for you!
Got something you want.
I got your bomb right here.
Want to blow something up?
Come on.
Push the button.
Come on.
-Push the button.
-What are you doing?
Just play along.
Come on, push the button.
Yeah, come on, push the button.
-Blow everybody up.
-Yeah, blow everybody up!
Push the goddamn button!
You heard what she said.
You got everybody excited about something being blowed up...
and look at your little punk British ass.
Push the button!
-Deal with it, please.
-Where you going?
Cover the consul!
It's OK.
She's a professional.
You must take the vest off.
Just give me a second.
There's a trigger on this vest.
It'Il blow if I take it off.
Haven't you done this before?
It's a little different in the practice room.
-Everybody take cover.
-We need more men down here.
Say again.
Dan, do you read...
Need some help down here, damn it!
Roses are red...
violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet...
and so are you.
The remote can still set if off.
Get rid of it.
-She OK?
-Yes.
I know that ain't the bomb.
Take that bomb away from me!
Take the bomb outside.
-Take it over to Juntao.
-Go that way, I go that way.
Don't shoot!
Where are you going?
-Meet me on the roof.
-Roger.
Don't move, man!
I been looking for your sweet-and-sour chicken ass.
Your boys ain't here now.
You all alone.
-I kill him.
-Go ahead.
I don't even like him.
Put your gun down.
Fight like a man.
-What you say?
-Fight like a man.
Fight like a man?
All right, l'm gonna kick your ass.
Then l'm gonna take your ass to jail.
All right, come on, put the gun down...
same time.
Wipe yourself off, man.
You're dead.
Thank you, God.
Oh, shit.
You know he dead.
Help!
Do something!
Hey, be cool, man!
Hang on!
I can't hold on anymore!
Hang on for about an hour.
I'm gonna get the ambulance.
-What are you doing?
-I'Il be right back.
-Carter!
-I was just playing.
Do something!
I can't hold on anymore!
Oh, shit!
Thank you!
-What the hell you doing?
-I was just being polite.
Next time, be polite to my nuts.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.
-I owe you everything.
-Only your friendship.
Look who's here.
What took you so long?
I think this belongs to you.
I think you should come with me.
Get on the plane when you get offwork.
You fly for free.
I'm trying to expand my horizons.
Travel a little bit.
I'm through with y'all, man.
I'm going on vacation.
Now, hold on there.
We were just coming by...
to tell you what a great job you did yesterday.
And when you come back...
there's gonna be an FBI badge waiting for you.
You serious?
Come on, don't be playing.
I don't know what to say.
It's like a dream come true.
I got an idea, though.
Why don't y'all take that badge...
and shove it up your ass?
All up your ass.
I'm LAPD.
Bitch.
First class.
I like this.
This is tight.
-Can I take yourjacket, sir?
-Myjacket?
No.
You can take this bag, though.
How you doing?
What's up?
What's up, man?
You ready to go?
May I offer you some peanuts?
You never told me you spoke Chinese.
I never told you I didn't.
You assumed I didn't.
This is cool.
Han letting me go to Hong Kong with you.
I ain't been on vacation in five years.
We can hang in my crib.
I will show you my hood.
You can show me a couple ofthem Chinese girls.
I want a massage.
I'm gonna get buck wild.
No police work for two weeks.
How long this flight?
-Fifteen hours.
-Fifteen hours?
What are we gonna do for fifteen hours?
Oh, hell, no!
Stewardess!
Get me another seat!
Action!
It broke.
Don't move!
Don't smile!
What is this shit about your daughter?
Fifty million dollars?
Who do you think you got, Kelsey Clinton?
Fifty million?
Who do you think you got, Kelsey...
What's the line?
Who do you think you got...
Is it Chelsea or Kelsey?
Who do you think you got, Chelsea Carter?
Who do you think you got, Chelsea Grammer...
Chelsea...
Who do you think you got, Chelsea Clinton?
Keep him talking...
Cut!
Go back to the beginning.
Was that it Chelsea...
did I get it?
Let me see your badge, buddy!
Show me your ass!
Show your ass?
Y'all scared...
You know that other stuff, but don't know his name?
Man, people tell me shit.
What's wrong with you?
My daddy once caught...
catch a bullet...
caught a bullet.
My daddy one caught a bullet by his bare hand.
No bullshit.
What's the honor in that?
You believe your father wasting his life...
They must not...
You're right, man.
Let's go tell them.
Anything goes wrong, you bust in there, act like you're LA...
He cannot speak English.
Man, this is cool.
Han sending us to Hong Kong.
What's that line?
May I offer you some peanuts?
See, how difficult is that?
My English?
He even cannot say three words, Chinese.
You need some lunch?
I got it before, Jackie.
Now you know how difficult I am.
So I'm gonna get a three-to-one return on my money?
Otto is the real deal.
I met him at a hash bar in Amsterdam.
He speaks Russian, German, Arabic...
Mr Ostroff's trust is not gained easily.
Two years it took me.
You see, Micky, he doesn't like new faces.
So tell me, why am I looking at a new face?
Otto Krieg, meet my friend, Bobby.
He's helping me with the finance.
He's not a cop.
Let's see the money.
You like it?
Yeah, I like it.
We have deal?
We have deal.
Bring 'em down!
Move!
Move in!
This is the FBI!
Put your hands on your head!
What is this?
You brought a cop, and he brought his fucking friends!
Don't look at me.
This is not good.
My father will kill me!
You're under arrest for the importation and sale of contraband firearms.
Scheisse!
Gun!
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Otto!
This is not my deal.
This is not my deal!
I don't even know these guys!
Cease fire!
Holy shit.
Holy shit.
Bobby!
Bobby!
Stay down!
I'm calling it.
It's : AM.
Bag him and ship him.
God, I hate this job.
Give me a hand, fellas.
Yeah.
All right, Frank.
We gotta get you outta here.
What the hell happened?
Who's the kid?
Definitely not in the plan.
But we beat the spread.
This isn't football.
It's a figure of speech.
People weren't supposed to die out there.
Get them IDed and get them to the morgue.
And get me my pants!
Can we get some pants over here?
Ah, shit.
Surprise!
To Frank Castle...
the finest soldier, the finest undercover op, the finest man I've ever known.
What am I gonna do without you?
Get a girlfriend.
Have fun in Puerto Rico, man.
Say hello to your folks.
Thanks.
Agent Weeks.
He's Robert Saint.
Howard Saint's son.
More paperwork for Tampa PD.
No, we can handle this.
See you, buddy!
See you, fellas!
Bail him now.
Bring him to the club.
Don't hit me.
Don't hit me.
Hey, Micky.
Don't hit me.
You sell homegrown pot by the ounce, Micky, not by the barrel.
You sell badly forged, fake passports to Haitians.
So what inspired you to become...
the Mr Universe of international arms dealers?
You should apologize for the death of Mr Saint's youngest child.
Okay, I know how it looks...
But Bobby, he buys pot from me.
And when he found out what I was doing, he insisted on coming in.
He put up half the cash.
He came of his own free will.
If you're gonna kill me, will you leave my face alone, for my mother?
We just made your bail.
If I wanted to kill you, I would have left you in jail where we have friends, and in some way that I can only describe as deeply pornographic, you would have been killed.
But you're a small piece of shit, and I don't want the karma of your death on my soul.
But on the other hand, maybe I don't believe in karma, so guys...
No, I'll tell you what I want to know.
I want to know one thing only, who brokered the deal?
His name is Otto Krieg.
And if it's any comfort to Mr Saint, he's dead too.
Well, it's not.
It's actually no comfort at all.
But what might be comforting to me, is to watch the slow death of the man who was supposed to be taking care of my son, and making sure that he did not get into trouble.
Now, Micky...
what would your father think of this?
Your father gave his life for me.
What would he say?
I didn't know it was gonna happen like this.
Please!
Well, ignorance is no excuse.
The man who is responsible for my son's death must die.
I told you to never let him out of your sight.
Mr Saint, Bobby told me to stay.
Tell him, John.
John!
Mr Saint!
It was Bobby's idea!
He wanted to go alone!
He thought he could impress you.
Thank you for that explanation.
My son didn't need to impress me.
More boxes, guys.
This was a hard one.
This was the last one.
It's over.
Tell that to your son.
He doesn't believe me.
Where is he?
You know.
You know what I miss most about Buck?
He could catch a ball, no matter how hard you threw it.
He was right there.
Why are we always moving?
This is the last time.
You said that last time.
I did?
Yeah.
You said we were leaving California and we were gonna move to Virginia, and you'd work in Washington...
and we'd never move again.
I guess I've said a lot of things, huh?
So why London?
London's a safe place where we can all be together.
No more more moving around, I promise.
Some day when you're older, Will...
I'll tell you why we had to move so much.
He was such a special boy.
Are you identifying this body as your son, Robert Saint?
He deserved better.
Somebody lied to him.
Promised him one thing, gave him another.
Do you know that I used to have to dress him till he was?
I'd tie his ties, and comb his hair...
I'll have to get him a new suit.
Who is Otto Krieg?
Who are the people who work for him?
Who are his friends?
Who would stand to make money from this deal?
Tell me.
We can't talk about the case, Mr Saint.
Now, I understand your grief, but for your own safety, leave this to professionals.
Professionals.
Yes...
I'll do that.
I'll do that.
Good bye, son.
We called New York, we called Las Vegas, we called Europe and Hong Kong, we even got the Sicilians in it for old time's sake.
With what you're paying Howard, we'll know everything about Otto Krieg within hours.
High five.
Come on.
That was cool!
Leave it.
We'll be back.
Race you?
Yeah.
Got anything left?
I don't see it!
Come on!
He did his free ascent on the first try.
I've seen Navy SEALs do worse.
That's what we like to hear.
I'm so proud of you.
Good job, babe.
Hey, Frank, is that that Candelaria?
Yeah, Manuel.
People around here call him a witch doctor.
He lives on that island way off the point.
Only one damn fool I know crazy enough to swim over there.
Gee, let me guess.
This is the first family reunion we've had in five years.
And that's too long.
That's too long.
Amen.
Two families and when you put them together, you get this: My grandson!
I just want to say that...
I'm very happy that you're all here.
I'm very proud that you're all here.
And that...
I love you.
Love you, too, Dad.
Salud!
Salud!
Hey!
Hey.
What happened?
What's wrong?
You know...
I can't believe I'm home...
and that I could ever be so lucky.
Because there were times, Maria, I gotta tell you...
Frank...
I lost so much time, with both of you.
And I'm really sorry...
Stop.
Hey, hey, hey.
I married you.
I knew what I was doing...
and I'd do it again.
You and I, we're not lucky, we are blessed.
I'll see you at home, son.
His name's Frank Castle.
Senior agent.
Just got the Bureau's London desk.
His alias, connections, apartments in Europe, none of it was real, not even his death.
Well, maybe it was.
Maybe...
he died and came back to life so he could die again.
You have your chance.
He's leaving for England next week and he's at a family reunion in Puerto Rico.
I think you should be there so you can come back and tell Livia how he died.
All right.
Wait.
His family.
His whole family.
Is this what you want?
Morning.
Hey.
We should have another.
I'm ready.
Another what?
Good morning, Will.
Come here.
They were selling Tshirts in town.
One of them was really scary.
The guy in the shop said it wards off evil spirits.
It's really intense.
You know about this?
Mm-hm.
Let's see here...
This is interesting.
Like it?
Like it?
I love it.
Thanks.
Nice.
Here you go.
Where's the camera?
Okay.
Come on!
You've gotta see this!
What?
Your Colts, you've done something to them.
You could say that.
I bore the chambers and customized the triggers and added some compensators.
They used to be pretty good, but now they're nail drivers.
Let's see.
Hey, Mom!
Look.
Wow!
Look at that.
It's a stingray.
Yeah.
Mom?
Get down, Willie!
Get down!
Get over here.
Under the boat.
Get under it.
Jesus!
Okay, I'm going to count to three, and we're going to run to the jeep.
Okay, honey?
What about Dad?
Dad'll be okay.
One...
two...
three...
Dad!
Go on, honey.
You hang on, honey!
Mom!
Are you okay?
Mom's gonna get help, okay?
Come on, baby.
Get out of the car.
Mom, my arm!
Come on, honey, you can do it.
My arm!
Mom, my arm.
I know, baby.
But we have to keep moving, okay?
I need you to be a big boy, and we have to keep moving, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Help!
Help!
Somebody help me!
Come on, baby!
Mom, here.
Grandpa's boat.
Run, honey!
No...
Maria!
My mother and father send their regards.
This time, they're not blanks.
Maria...
It's me, Castle.
Candelaria.
I'll take care of you.
Are you gonna make love to that car, or park it?
Get that junk out of here!
Thank you.
Come on, fellas.
Big crowd tonight, Mr Saint.
You look beautiful, Mrs Saint.
Little prick.
Holy shit!
To Bobby.
To Bobby.
To a score settled.
Quentin, go dance with Livia.
All these feelings From my intuition...
When did you speak to him?
About an hour ago, Mr Saint.
Try the Grand Turk.
I got something for you.
Harry Winston.
Beautiful.
Without you, they're just diamonds.
I asked you to avenge our son and you did.
Thank you.
Vaya con Dios, Castle.
Go with God.
God's going to sit this one out.
La donna é mobile qual piuma al vento!
You are insignificant.
You are a coward.
You are a great disappointment to your mother and I!
Yes!
Die!
Die!
Die!
I'm the most amazing man in the world!
It's really loud.
Is it supposed to be that loud?
Oh, it's beautiful.
He hasn't slept all week.
How do you know?
'Cause I haven't slept all week.
What do you think he does?
Maybe he's an artist.
Wow!
Our neighbor is an artist.
You are the expert on artistes?
I've known a few.
So what do you think he's doing?
Ask him.
Oh, yeah, right.
"Ask him." I'm late for work.
Bye, Joan.
Bye, Joan.
Bye.
This is undignified.
You're supposed to be dead.
Let's talk.
Stay away from me, Castle.
I have friends, you know?
Let's talk about your friends.
Make you own friends, buddy.
I'm not saying nothing.
I talk to you, they'll kill me.
You don't help me, I'll kill you now, Mick.
The Saints tell me nothing.
Nothing?
They pay your rent...
your legal bills...
You should know something.
What's the torch for?
degrees, Mick.
Enough to turn steel into butter.
It won't hurt at first.
It's too hot, you see?
The flame sears the nerve endings shut, killing them.
You'll go into shock...
and all you'll feel is...
cold.
Isn't science fun, Micky?
I don't know shit.
You'll smell burning meat, and then...
then it'll hurt.
I swear I'm telling the truth!
Son of a bitch!
Oh, my God.
Should we call the police?
Let's stay out of it.
He's a very scary man.
He's killing someone and we're next.
Exactly.
Wait, wait!
Smell that, Mick?
I'm burning off some of your fat.
I'll tell you anything, anything, anything you want to know.
That's a good boy.
Okay, okay.
Any discussion of Howard Saint's business involves two Cubans...
the Toro brothers.
They control all the prostitution and gambling up and down the Gulf Coast...
tons of cash.
They give their dirty money to Howard Saint, who transports it in cigarette boats to his banks in Gran Cayman, washes it and wires it back clean as a whistle.
For the love of God!
You are not a nice person.
So what's up, you're gonna string up Howard Saint and blowtorch him?
I like that idea...
But I have something better.
Guess what?
You're gonna help me.
Unless you want to stay Howard Saint's lackey for the rest of you life.
I hate the Saints.
All of them.
Tell me about them.
What they do, where.
When.
Howard Saint's a man of strict habits.
He has first tee time five days a week at Tampa Springs.
Never fails.
He likes money, he likes power, but the thing this guy covets most, the wife, Livia.
What happened to your family...
Howard did that for her.
She's just like him, and she's just as predictable.
Every Thursday, she works out, gets her nails done and goes to the movies.
Howard knows every move this broad makes.
Any man who looks at her wrong, he ends up in Tampa Bay.
Let's not forget Johnny boy, the son you didn't kill.
What a putz.
Last but no least, Quentin Glass.
Been with Howard years...
the family consigliore, lawyer, CPA and a sadist.
Who knows what's going on with this guy?
Yes?
Pop, you are not going to believe this.
No, I think I might.
Chief Morris, will the budget cuts mean less officers on the street?
Thank you.
Thank you.
What impact will all this have on police layoffs?
Castle?
Frank Castle?
Hey, I thought you were dead.
Wait, hold them.
Where have you been?
It's been five months since my family was killed, and I don't see one man in jail.
Obviously you're upset.
Upset?
Is that the word?
I used to get upset when I had a flat tire.
I used to get upset when a plane was delayed.
I used to get upset when the Yankees won the series.
So if that's what "upset" means, then how do I feel now?
If you know the word, tell me, because...
I don't.
Taxi!
Enrique, ¿ qué pasó?
Get up.
Wheel the money out.
Fill that up.
You know whose money this is?
You know whose building this is?
Howard Saint's.
He's going to fuck your life up.
He already fucked my life up.
Now, out the window.
What?
Out the window.
Good business, murder?
Did Saint pay for each one, or does he get a group-rate discount?
Our top story this morning, a double homicide in downtown Tampa.
Two men were gunned down in the lobby of the Saint building...
Frank Castle is alive and back in Tampa.
You may remember, Castle's the FBI agent presumed dead...
He speaks six languages, he did two tours and special Ops CTU.
What's CTU?
Counter Terrorism Unit.
At this hour, Tampa police do not have a motive and no arrests have been made.
That's the latest news at this hour...
It's him.
Hi, there.
I just want to say that I'm very happy that you're all here, very proud that you're all here.
I guess I've said a lot of things.
We're not lucky, we are blessed.
Maria!
How is he still alive?
I don't know, Quentin.
I wasn't there.
Why is he still alive?
That's an interesting question.
Maybe he's still alive because he was meant to suffer more.
I don't know.
But how can we make him suffer if we can't find him?
He's daring us.
No, no, he misses his family and he wants to die.
He's asking for help, so let's help him.
Did the Toros call?
They'll be here tomorrow morning.
You invited them to this house?
They invited themselves, Howard.
Mike, Joe.
Welcome.
Let's get a drink.
We don't have time for that, Howard.
Oh my God, this weather.
Yeah, just a little polluted, don't you think so?
I've seen hurricanes.
I've seen it rain like cats and dogs.
But never in all my years have I seen it rain hundred-dollar bills.
Yeah, this rainmaker, Castle, he was supposed to be dead, no?
Yeah.
Guys, look...
come on...
been working together for years.
First time anything like this ever happened.
At a personal loss to us of $ million, Howard.
That's one time too many.
Do you want us to find another banker?
No.
Okay.
Look, we want our money back, all right?
And we want protection on the next shipment.
Do you guarantee our money this time?
With everything I've got.
In hours, Castle is a memory.
A pro from Memphis.
The best.
Come on, Joannie.
Open up the goddamn door, you fucking bitch!
I want to talk with you now Honey, you're hurting my feelings.
Joannie, open up the goddamn door!
You're hurting my feelings, you bitch!
Hmm, dude?
It's kind of late.
Yeah?
What time is it in Hawaii?
You should leave right now.
Shut your face, you lard ass.
Joannie, come on, baby, let me in.
I'm gonna call the cops.
Are you?
You'll call the cops?
You'll call the cops?
Call them!
Call them!
Call them!
Call them!
Call them!
Call them!
Hey!
Get out.
What, what, what?
He don't have his tricks anymore?
And the speed?
Huh?
What, what, what...
You shouldn't play with knives.
No one's ever stood up for me before.
Come on, champ.
Let's get some ice on that.
Come on.
Frank kicked his ass, huh?
He's fine, he's all right.
I...
I've lived in seven cities in seven years and...
in each one, I've managed to find the one guy who will treat me the worst.
But I'm trying to fix that.
You're Castle.
Used to be.
We saw you on TV.
I don't have one.
I'm Joan.
Dave's the one with all the...
the metal.
And Bumpo's is the...
well, you can probably figure out which one Bumpo is.
We are really sorry.
About what?
About your family.
Did you know them?
No.
I'm over it.
Don't let your memories kill you.
They won't kill me.
Glass.
Quentin Glass?
Who is this?
I have certain photographic studies of you and your boyfriend.
Meet me at the bar, at the Wyndham Hotel.
Bring $ and I'll give you the photos.
You wouldn't want Howard Saint to see them, Mr Glass.
Thank you, sir.
Have a good night.
Quentin is late.
Do you know were he is?
I have no idea.
Have you seen your mother?
It's Thursday, Pop.
Right.
Movies.
Mr Saint?
I know where Mr Glass is.
I saw him pulling into the Wyndham Hotel a couple of hours ago.
Howard?
Come here.
I was just telling Quentin about the movie.
Where have you been, Quentin?
I've been looking for you.
I dozed off out by the pool.
That's funny.
What's funny?
Micky said that he saw you at the Wyndham.
Micky should have his eyes checked.
So he's mistaken?
Yes, Howard, he's mistaken.
Oh, my goodness.
These pancakes are really good, Joan.
What's he been doing for the last few days?
Drinking.
A lot.
Good morning, sir.
Sit anywhere you like.
I can hear what you're thinking All your doubts and fears And if you look in my eye In time, you'll find the reason I'm here And in time, all things shall pass away In time, you may come back some day To live once more Or die once more But in time, your time will be no more.
Do I know you?
I know you.
You're that boy in the newspaper, came back from the dead.
I didn't catch your name.
You like that song?
I wrote that for you.
I'm gonna sing it at your funeral.
You are one dumb son of a bitch.
Bring a knife to a gunfight.
Mås råpido, mås råpido!
Come on, let's move.
Let's move!
All of it?
All?
Look at this, Joe.
This is what I'm talking about.
Don't touch me, cojones.
Don't tell the Toros, till we have a plan.
Look at this place.
Isn't it beautiful?
Howard, we had chicken a la Havana tonight.
Very tasty.
Don't touch the Cubans.
Have you heard the news?
A shipment of cash was torched at Malaqui.
Whose money was it, huh?
Our mother always put her cash in the mattress, which I thought it was a good idea till the house burned down.
It was a big fire.
She lost everything.
That's what happens when you don't watch your money.
You lose everything, Howard.
Everything.
shipments are perfect.
One went bad and I get this, why?
Because you want to scare me?
There's no insurance in this business.
You know that.
So I'm not covering you fucking losses.
And Mike, if you don't like it, just remember one thing: I've got more guns than you do.
It's not even Cuban, Howard.
It's Honduran.
They're animals.
With all due respect, we don't have more guns.
It's my duty to...
It's your duty to make Castle dead!
I don't care what it takes, what it costs.
Call the Russian.
Hi.
Mr Castle, we need you help right now, because the guy who's after Joan is in her apartment...
right now.
We want you to have dinner with us.
I know it's not Thanksgiving, but um...
I'd like us to all say what we're thankful for.
I'll start.
I'm thankful to be alive this year.
And to have a job.
And to be sober.
Yeah, I'm thankful for my mom...
getting out of jail.
You know, it's cool.
And this girl gave me her number...
which is also cool.
Thanks for leftovers.
I'm full.
Thanks for Diet Pepsi.
And thanks for good neighbors.
Thanks for dinner.
There's dessert.
Ice Florentine.
You have to try my Ice Florentine.
Come on, Dave.
Come on.
I need your help.
No, no.
I'll do that.
I know what it's like.
I know what it's like to try and make your memories go away.
You can make new memories.
Good ones.
Good memories can save your life.
I'm not what you're looking for.
La donna é mobile Qual piuma al vento Muta d'accento E di pensiero Sempre un'amabile Leggiadro...
E sempre misero Chi a lei s'affida Chi le confida Mal cauto il core Pur mai non sentesi Felice appieno Chi su quel seno Non liba amore La donna é mobil Qual piuma al vento Muta d'accento...
Did you feel that?
No, no, no.
...E di pensier.
Mr Castle?
Frank?
I'm fine.
He's not.
We have to get him to a hospital.
He needs a doctor.
You need a doctor.
No hospital, no police.
Okay, all right.
All right.
I know what he wants.
Okay.
Okay.
Jesus.
It sure looks like you know what you're doing, Joan.
I don't know much, but I'm good with a needle.
Don't ask.
This will hurt.
He looks weak.
Is he going to die?
Appearances aren't everything.
You can let go now.
We have to move him.
Where?
There's no place to go.
What do we do?
Elevator.
Nice.
Okay, come on.
Let's go.
Careful...
Where's Castle?
Frank Castle, who lives here.
I asked you a question, fat man.
Leave him alone.
Then I'll ask you.
Where's Castle?
He's not here.
Really?
Are you sure?
What did you say?
Hmm?
I'm having a difficult time hearing you.
I said...
I'm not saying shit.
I don't want you to say shit, I want you to answer me.
You don't want to say anything about anything you might know?
Maybe we should get to know each other a little better.
What's your name?
Dave.
You go to school around here?
You don't go to school?
No.
No, I dropped out.
You dropped out?
You're not doing drugs, are you?
Not right now.
And what are you doing with all this stuff?
What is it?
Piercings.
Piercings?
Did it hurt when you did that?
Not really.
You like that?
Did it hurt a little bit?
That's a special one there, isn't it?
Is that your favorite?
That's hard to get.
Yeah.
Answer my question, please.
No.
Come here.
No.
Your friend 's about to have a bad day.
You can save him by talking.
It doesn't have to be this way.
You think you know about pain, boy?
What do you know about pain?
That's okay.
That's okay.
Are you going to tell me?
Dave?
Dave?
Are you going to tell me?
No!
Huh?
Why don't you and I see if we can discover the true nature of pain?
Stop.
Come here, Dave.
Come on, come on.
You want to talk to me?
No!
You can talk to me.
Talk to me, Dave.
If they knew, they would have talked.
They must not have known.
lf...
when he shows up...
kill him.
Go ahead.
Castle's alive.
The Russian's dead.
Where is Quentin?
Home.
I'm at the office.
Close the club.
Get everyone in.
We're going hunting.
I'll be back after : .
Darling?
It's Thursday.
Bye, sweetie.
Look what they did to him.
They tried to make me talk.
I gave them nothing.
You don't know me.
You don't owe me anything.
I've brought you nothing but trouble.
Why are you ready to die for me?
Because, you're one of us.
You're family.
Get him to a hospital.
Come on, champ, they'll get you all fixed up.
Say you kill them all...
then what?
What makes you any different from them?
They have something to lose.
You're gonna die tonight, aren't you?
Is that what you want?
"I leave this as a declaration of intent, so no one will be confused.
'Sic vis pacem para bellum.
' Latin.
The boot camp sergeant made us recite it like a prayer...
'Sic vis pacem para bellum'...
'lf you want peace, prepare for war.
"' Glass.
Those pictures of you...
I changed my mind.
The number's now $ .
Be at McNab's the men's store on Broadway at : PM, or they'll have their own website.
Listen to me, you son of...
Remember...
: PM.
Just do it, Glass.
Duka speaking.
You're on.
Mr Saint, how do you want me to pay for this?
Pay for what?
I was detailing Mrs Saint's car and I found this ticket.
Just take care of it.
Where was it?
The Wyndham Hotel.
What's that date?
September th.
Last Thursday.
Where did you say Quentin was last Thursday?
The Wyndham Hotel.
But Mrs Saint was at the movies last Thursday, wasn't she?
Do you have Quentin's house keys?
Sure.
I do his laundry.
Micky?
Get me last month's phone bill.
Yes, sir.
Need help with some underpants, sir?
Go fuck yourself.
Evening, Quentin.
Howard.
What are you doing here?
Jim Bowie.
Excuse me?
You know, Jim Bowie, the colonel...
the man who died in The Alamo...
had a knife named after him.
He was a gambler.
And when he was accused of cheating at cards, what he would do is take the guy in the other room, move the furniture like so...
then he'd take his knife, he'd throw it in the ground...
and the one that left...
got the money.
Gee, I didn't know that, Howard.
The only problem is that you have too much furniture.
I'm not following this.
I'm accusing you.
Of what?
Cheating.
I've never taken a cent from you.
Where were the two of you going to do it next time, the Wyndham?
Two who?
You and the whore.
I don't know what you are talking about.
You're good.
You should have been a stage actor.
Maybe next lifetime.
What are you doing?
You better pick up the knife, Quentin.
If you don't, I will.
I don't need to grab a knife, Howard.
This isn't funny, Howard.
Whoa!
What?
What?!
How long have you worked for me?
You think I'm an idiot?
Have you lost your mind...
You were my brother.
I gave you everything, didn't I?
But it wasn't enough.
My Liv.
What has she told you?
Don't you see?
Don't...
don't do this!
Don't, don't, don't do this.
Howard...
you're killing me.
You're killing me.
Why?
Why are you killing me?
Why are you killing me?
What the hell are you doing?
I know about you and Quentin.
Quentin?
You went to the movies last Thursday, :?
Yes.
Then at : you called him from your car?
Must've been a short movie.
Howard, there's an explanation.
I know, I know.
You're fucking him.
You're fucking my best friend.
That would be a little hard to accomplish, Howard.
Oh, so true.
So true.
Howard.
You should really learn to pay your parking tickets.
What...
You thought we...
Howard...
Quentin was gay.
You'd say anything!
I don't know what happened.
Would you just talk to me?!
Howard, Howard.
Howard.
You have to listen to me.
Please, Howard.
Please, Howard.
Do you recognize the neighborhood?
Little Cuba.
Just think, the first time I saw you was only three blocks from here.
Look at me, Howard.
Of course then, the neighborhood was much more colorful.
Look at me.
Howard, please.
Please, Howard.
Now it's just for whores.
You'll fit right in.
Look at that rock!
Look at it!
Take a look!
I gave you that when I had nothing.
All I asked for in return, was loyalty.
I have been loyal to you, Howard.
You're not making any sense!
I'm not making sense?
Here, look at this.
I found that in Quentin's bed.
Does that make enough sense for you?
Huh, huh?
No.
Me neither.
I'd like to go to the club.
I need a Martini.
$ a piece.
And $ more to the man who kills him.
If you accept this money, you are in till it's over.
Where have you been?
Huh?
Where's Quentin?
Oh...
well, he's wrapped up in something.
I called home, no one was there.
Your mother's gone.
What?
She took the train.
Frank Castle is dead.
He died with his family.
In certain extreme situations, the law is inadequate.
In order to shame its inadequacy, it is necessary to act outside the law, to pursue...
natural justice.
This is not vengeance.
Revenge is not a valid motive, it's an emotional response.
No, not vengeance...
punishment." Hey, Eddie, more champagne on the double.
Coming right up.
Stop!
You look like a strong kid.
You must work out.
Ever try isometrics?
This antipersonnel mine weighs eight pounds.
Not much.
Well...
try holding it with an outstretched arm.
Hell of a workout.
Don't leave me like this.
Don't leave me like this!
Help, please.
Howard Saint.
Howard Saint!
You took everything from me.
You killed my son.
Both of them.
I made you kill your best friend.
I made you kill your wife.
Oh, God.
And now I've killed you.
You're right, good memories can save your life.
When Dave gets out of the hospital, check the cupboard.
I left something.
For all of you.
You're leaving?
I have work to do.
Read your newspaper every day.
You'll understand.
Which section?
Obituaries.
"Those who do evil to others...
the killers, the rapists, psychos, sadists...
you will come to know me well.
Frank Castle is dead.
Call me...
What are you gonna do today, Napoleon?
Whatever I feel like I want to do.
Gosh!
Your current event, Napoleon.
Last week, Japanese scientists "explaced"...
placed explosive detonators at the bottom of Lake Loch Ness...
to blow Nessie out of the water.
Sir Curt Godfrey of the Nessie Alliance...
summoned the help of Scotland's local wizards...
to cast a protective spell over the lake and its local residents...
and all those who seek for the peaceful existence of our underwater ally.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Hey, Napoleon, what'd you do all last summer again?
I told you.
I spent it with my uncle in Alaska hunting wolverines.
Did you shoot any?
Yes, like of'em.
They kept tryin'to attack my cousins.
What the heck would you do in a situation like that?
What kind of gun did you use?
A frickin' -gauge.
What do you think?
You think you're funny?
Just watch your step.
But I didn't...
Hey, could I use your guys's phone for a sec?
Is there anything wrong?
I don't feel very good.
Hi.
Is Grandma there?
No, she's getting her hair done.
What do you need?
Can you just go get her for me?
I'm really busy right now.
Well, just tell her to come get me.
Why?
'Cause I don't feel good.
Well, have you talked to the school nurse?
No, she doesn't know anything.
Will you just come get me?
No.
Well, will you do me a favor then?
What?
Can you bring me my ChapStick?
No, Napoleon.
But my lips hurt real bad.
Just borrow some from the school nurse.
I know she has, like, five sticks in her drawer.
I'm not gonna use hers, you sicko.
See ya.
Idiot!
David Dempke, please come to the office.
David Dempke, please come to the office.
David Dempke.
You do understand English?
This isn't that complex.
Look, the cafeteria's down the hall...
to the right and downstairs.
Hey, is that a new kid or something?
Napoleon, this is Pedro.
Would you mind showing him where his locker is?
Sure.
Come on.
You know, there's, like, a buttload of gangs at this school.
This one gang kept wanting me to join 'cause I'm pretty good with a bow staff.
Do you ride the bus to school?
No.
I ride my bike.
What kind of bike do you have?
It's a Sledgehammer.
Dang!
You got shocks, pegs.
Lucky!
You ever take it off any sweet jumps?
You got, like, three feet of air that time.
Can I try it really quick?
Dang it!
I love the way...
your sandy hair...
floats in the air.
To me it's like a lullaby.
I'm just flying by, oh, so high...
like a kite tied to a stake.
How was school?
The worst day of my life.
What do you think?
Well, I want you to go see ifTina wants some of this.
Kip hasn't done flipping anything today.
Look, tonight me and your...
Kip, listen!
What?
Tonight me and your aunt are gonna go visit some friends...
and we're not gonna be back till tomorrow.
We're gettin'low on steak, so I got Lyle comin'over tomorrow to take care of it.
Well, what's there to eat?
Knock it off, Napoleon.
Make yourself a dang quesadilla!
Fine!
I'll be back tomorrow.
Stay home and eat all the freakin'chips, Kip!
Napoleon, don't be jealous that I've been chatting online with babes all day.
Besides, we both know I'm training to become a cage fighter.
Since when, Kip?
You have the worst reflexes of all time.
Try and hit me, Napoleon.
What?
I said come down here and see what happens if you try and hit me.
Such an idiot.
Let me see what your best move is.
I'll go get it.
Geez!
Um, hello.
Would you like to look like this?
This is a girl.
Because for a limited time only...
glamour shots by Deb are % off.
I already get my hair cut at the Cuttin'Corral.
Well, maybe you'd be interested in some home-woven handicrafts.
I'm Rex...
founder of the Rex Kwon Do Self-Defense System.
After one week with me in my dojo, you'll be prepared to defend yourself...
with the strength of a grizzly...
the reflexes of a puma...
and the wisdom of a man.
Come down today for your free trial lesson!
In here we have some boondoggle key chains.
A must-have for this season's fashion.
I already made, like, infinity of those at Scout camp.
Well, is anyone else here?
I'm trying to earn money for college.
Your mom goes to college.
Let's bring in that...
Tina, you fat lard.
Come get some dinner.
Tina, eat.
Eat the food.
Eat the food!
It'd be nice if you could pull me into town.
My name is Rex, and if you study with my eight-week program...
you will learn a system of self-defense...
that I developed over two seasons of fighting in the Octagon.
It's called Rex Kwon Do!
I need a volunteer.
Okay, you'll do.
Come up here.
Bow to your sensei.
Bow to your sensei!
Okay.
Now, I'm gonna give you one chance.
One chance, people.
Give me your best shot.
All right.
That was pretty good.
Okay.
Now, watch this, everybody.
Grab my arm.
The other arm.
My other arm.
Now watch this.
I'm just gonna break the wrist and walk away.
Break the wrist, walk away.
Geez!
Okay.
It's just that simple.
Now, I want you to kick me.
Come on.
Kick me.
Okay, do it again.
Do it again.
Ouch.
Okay.
You'll block it every time.
Have a seat.
Now, in addition to what you just saw...
if you study with my eight-week program, you're gonna learn these things.
First off...
Rex Kwon Do, we use the buddy system.
No more flyin'solo.
You need somebody watching your back at all times.!
Second off, you're gonna learn to discipline your image.
Do you think I got where I am today...
because I dress like Peter Pan here?
Take a look at what I'm wearing, people.
Do you think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face...
while I'm wearin' these bad boys?
Forget about it.
Last off...
my students will learn about self-respect.
Do you think anybody thinks I'm a failure because I go home to Starla at night?
Forget about it.!
Now, for only $ you can sign up right now...
for my eight-week program.
Well, that place was a rip-off.
Hey, Lyle.
Nothin'on here works smooth.
So me and you are pretty much friends by now, right?
Yes.
So, you got my back and everything?
What?
Never mind.
Have you heard about the dance?
Yes.
Have you met anyone to ask yet?
No.
But I probably will after school.
Who you gonna ask?
That girl over there.
She braided my hair one time...
Summer Wheatly?
How the heck are you gonna do that?
Build her a cake or something.
Yeah, my old girlfriend from Oklahoma...
was gonna fly out here for the dance...
but she couldn't 'cause she's doing some modeling right now.
Is she hot?
See for yourself.
Wow.
Yeah, I took her to the mall to get some glamour shots for her birthday one year.
I like her bangs.
Me too.
How long did it take you to grow that mustache?
A couple of days.
I wish I could grow one.
Are you gonna eat your Tots?
No.
Can I have 'em?
You see that girl over there?
She came over to my house the other day.
Why?
I don't know...
but she left all this crap on my porch.
She's pretty good-looking.
Do you dare me to go talk to her?
Sure.
I see you're drinking one-percent.
Is that 'cause you think you're fat?
'Cause you're not.
You could be drinking whole if you wanted to.
Well, I have all your equipment in my locker.
You should probably come get it 'cause I can't fit my nunchakus in there anymore.
Where's your locker?
Hey, can I have one of your key chains?
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Hello?
Napoleon, give me some of your Tots.
No, go find your own.
Come on.
Give me some of your Tots.
No.
I'm freakin'starved.
I didn't get to eat anything today.
G...
Gross.
Freakin'idiot!
Tina, come get some ham.
What are you doing here, Uncle Rico?
Your grandma took a little spill at the sand dunes today, broke her coccyx.
What?
Since when does she go to the dunes?
Looks like there's a lot you don't know about her.
So, when's Grandma coming back?
I don't know.
Not sure.
You don't have to stay here with us.
We're not babies.
Talk to your Auntie Caroline.
Well, Kip is, like, years old.
I don't mind if you stay.
Oh.
Thanks, Kip.
What the flip was Grandma doin'at the sand dunes?
She was on a date...
with her boyfriend.
Boyfriend?
Hey, you guys want to see my video?
So, what do you think?
It's pretty cool, I guess.
Oh.
Man, I wish I could go back in time.
I'd take state.
This is pretty much the worst video ever made.
Napoleon, like anyone can even know that.
You know what, Napoleon?
You can leave.
You guys are retarded.
Hah!
Hey, check that out.
So, you and Tammy still together?
No.
Not really.
Why is that?
Well...
she's jealous.
Says I'm livin' too much in ' .
Well, I dumped her.
What about your girlfriend?
Well, things are gettin' pretty serious right now.
I mean, we chat online for, like, two hours every day...
so I guess you could say things are gettin'pretty serious.
I'm just really tryin'to raise a few bucks right now so I can bring her around for a few days.
Yep.
Well, what's she look like?
She's, uh...
She's got sandy blonde hair.
She's, uh, pretty-look...
pretty good-looking face, but...
I'm just gettin'really...
just kinda T.O.'d...
because, I mean, she hasn't even sent me a full body shot yet.
Hey, you know...
I got a little project...
that we might be able to make a little moola with.
Really?
That sounds pretty good.
Have you ever heard of nylon polymer?
Go for it.
Back in ' I used to be able to throw a pigskin a quarter mile.
Are you serious?
I'm dead serious.
Watch this.
What the heck are you doing?
That's what I'm talkin'about.
I better go.
How much you want to make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains?
Yeah.
If coach would've put me in fourth quarter...
we'd have been state champions, no doubt.
No doubt in my mind.
You better believe things would have been different.
I'd have gone pro...
in a heartbeat.
I'd be makin' millions of dollars and...
livin'in a...
big ol'mansion somewhere.
You know, soakin'it up in a hot tub with my soul mate.
Kip...
Kip...
I reckon you know a lot about cyberspace.
Y-You ever come across anything like time travel?
Easy.
I've already looked into it for myself.
Right on.
Right on.
Is Pedro here today?
I don't think so.
Why?
Just wondering.
Can you, uh, give this to him for me?
Okay.
Hey, Summer, you want to play me?
Mm-mmm.
Ow.
God.
What are you drawing?
A liger.
What's a liger?
It's pretty much my favorite animal.
It's like a lion and a tiger mixed.
Bred for its skills in magic.
Hmm.
Where's your friend?
I don't know.
Did you see him today?
No.
Neither did I.
Do you need a ride?
No.
I missed the bus today, but my uncle's coming to get me.
Oh.
See ya.
Right.
l...
I think...
just a little bit east of the cemetery is a good little area right here.
We should do it there.
Don't go down here, 'cause they don't have any money.
So, how long are we talkin'about workin'?
What are you...
You're already losing your steam?
No.
I just...
I have a chat room meeting at : .
I gotta be back here by then.
All right, you just start a little earlier.
That's all.
All right.
Or else work afterwards.
How long's the chat room?
Geez, sometimes up to three, four hours maybe.
Maybe not.
I don't know.
You...
You pay the bills for that?
Does that cost money every time you're on, like for minutes on the phone?
Yeah.
Grandma's still payin'per minute.
She gets kind of pissed at me sometimes 'cause I'm on there so long.
I'll bet she does.
I'd be throwin'you out the window.
Bueno.
Hello?
Who's this?
Napoleon Dynamite.
Who?
Napoleon Dynamite.
I'm one of Pedro's best friends.
Your name is Napoleon?
Yes.
Is Pedro there?
No, he's not here right now.
Okay, bye.
See, Crystal Street.
That's for you.
I'm goin'to Adams Park.
They got some money in Adams Park.
What?
Let's go, Kipper.
I think we should take this...
someplace a little more private.
That's a good idea.
Please.
Please.
Be good to me.
Please, keep going.
Dead on.
Dead on.
Yes!
Before we get started on our new project, I have a few concerns.
First off, I'm concerned about your transportation situation.
I mean, do you...
you got a car you can borrow from someone?
Well, that's the problem right now.
At the moment, nothing comes to mind.
You can borrow my van for the time being.
l...
I do better on foot anyway.
We also need some way to make us look official, like we got all the answers.
How about some gold bracelets?
We need, like, some name tags...
with our picture on it, all laminated and whatnot.
I mean, we gotta look legit, man.
That's true.
That's true.
Say, you know of a...
a place we can get our picture taken...
like a...
a photo store?
Okay.
Turn your head on more of a slant.
Now, make a fist...
and slowly ease it up underneath your chin.
This is looking really good.
You can say that again.
Okay, hold still right there.
Now, just imagine you're weightless.
You're in the middle of the ocean...
surrounded by tiny little sea horses.
That was the one.
I think that's gonna come out really nice.
Uh, you did it?
Wow.
Wow, that felt really relaxed.
Thanks, Deb.
You're up, Kip.
Is there some kind of vest that I can wear?
Where have you been?
I got sick.
Has Summer said anything to you yet?
No, not yet.
Well, she said no.
She did?
Well, what about that other girl?
What other girl?
The one that left all that crap on your porch.
You mean Deb?
Yes, her.
What about her?
Well, I asked her out too.
What?
Well, nobody's gonna go out with me.
Have you asked anybody yet?
No, but who would?
I don't even have any good skills.
What do you mean?
You know, like...
nunchaku skills, bow hunting skills...
computer hacking skills.
Girls only want boyfriends who have great skills.
Aren't you pretty good at drawing, like...
animals and warriors and stuff?
Yes.
Probably the best that I know of.
Just draw a picture of the girl you want to take out...
and give it to her for, like, a gift or something.
That's a pretty good idea.
Now, if you invest in the -piece set...
I'm gonna throw in a little gift.
So, what's the gift?
I bet you folks don't have one of these.
I want that.
You see, this ain't your run-of-the-mill "crapper-ware." These are some serious "NuPont" fiber-woven bowls.
So, if we purchase the -piece set...
the mini sailboat is included?
That's correct, sir.
Lance, you look like a strong young pup.
Why don't you see if you can give that a nice tear.
Don't hurt yourself now.
I can't do it.
Can't.
So, uh...
how does the "dealio" sound to you?
Dang it.
Is Trisha here?
Oh, I'm sorry, she's not.
She's at a friend's house right now.
Well, hey, Napoleon.
Napoleon's my nephew.
Oh, that's nice.
Could you just give this to her for me?
I certainly could.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Poor kid.
I've been takin'care of him while his grandma's in the hospital.
He still wets the bed and everything.
You're kidding.
Yeah, he's a tender little guy.
He still gets beat up and whatnot.
Anyway, uh...
so we still feelin'pretty good about this, uh, -piece set here?
Ow!
What the crap was Uncle Rico doin'at my girlfriend's house?
Napoleon, let go of me!
I think you're bruisin'my neck meat!
Fine.
What the heck are you guys doin'?
Tryin'to ruin my life and make me look like a friggin'idiot?
I'm out makin'some sweet moola with Uncle Rico.
Geez, I think you ripped my mole off.
I did?
Yeah, is it bleeding?
A little bit.
Hey, Kip.
I wish you wouldn't look at me like that, Napoleon.
I wish you'd get out of my life and shut up.
I'm gonna tell you somethin'.
While you're playin' patty-cake with your friend Pedro...
your Uncle Rico...
is makin' bucks.
I could make that much money in five seconds.
Geez.
Yeah, right, Napoleon.
I made, like, bucks today.
Napoleon, it looks like you don't have a job.
So why don't you get out there and feed Tina.
Why don't you go eat a "decroded" piece of crap.
There's a lot more where this came from...
if you go to the dance with me.
Yours truly, Napoleon Dynamite.
You know you're gonna go to that dance with that boy.
By noon I need them hens moved into their new cages.
Sometimes they don't want to cooperate.
But you give 'em a good shakin', they'll settle down for ya.
Do the chickens have large talons?
Do they have what?
Large talons.
I don't understand a word you just said.
Okay, you meet me back here about noon, and, uh...
we'll have a little lunch waitin'for ya.
Ew!
Well, dig in.
Over there, in that pigpen...
I found a couple of Shoshoni arrowheads.
Can't find my checkbook.
Hope you don't mind I pay you in change.
Six dollars.
That's, like, a dollar an hour.
Hello?
Hi.
Is Napoleon there?
Yes.
Can I talk to him?
You already are.
Oh.
Napoleon, this is Trisha.
I'm just calling to tell you that...
I can go to the dance with you.
And also...
I wanted to thank you for the beautiful drawing you did of me.
It's hanging in my bedroom.
Really?
Took me, like, three hours to finish the shading on your upper lip.
It's probably the best drawing I've ever done.
Yeah, it's really...
nice.
Yeah, well, I'll probably pick you up at : for the dance.
Is that okay?
That's fine.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
Who was that?
Trisha.
Who's she?
My woman I'm takin'to the dance.
You draw her a picture?
Heck, yes, I did!
Well, what are you going to wear to the dance?
Just, like, a silk shirt or something.
What are you gonna wear?
Dad has something for me.
But you should probably get a suit.
Pedro, how do you feel about that one?
It looks nice.
Yeah.
It looks pretty sweet.
It looks awesome.
That suit, it's...
It's incredible.
I need you to give me a ride in an hour.
Where to?
The dance.
You takin'my client's daughter?
Yes.
We need to pick her up too.
Well, Uncle Rico's got a sale to finalize in Bonita in five minutes.
Can't you take me and then drop me off when you're done or whatever?
Well, I'll be back in a minute.
Don't disturb me while I'm in there.
Well, hurry up, 'cause I gotta get Trisha.
Hi.
I got your -piece set right here.
[Engine Revving, Rumbling] So you guys are, like, Pedro's cousins with all the sweet hookups?
Simón.
Is Trisha here?
Who's that in my driveway?
That's my ride.
[Hip-hop Continues, Loud, Indistinct] Do you wanna go over by my friend Pedro and dance really quick?
Napoleon.
When did you get here?
Just a couple minutes ago.
Have you guys seen Trisha anywhere?
No.
Oh.
She probably just went to the bathroom.
Are you guys having a killer time?
Yes.
If you can't find Trisha, I'll let you dance with Deb for a few songs.
I like your sleeves.
They're real big.
Thank you.
I made them myself.
So you and Pedro are getting really serious now?
No.
We're just friends.
Huh.
How your glamour shots been going lately?
Pretty good.
I could do a personal portrait sometime...
if you wanted to come over.
Okay.
Do you think people will vote for me?
Heck, yes.
I'd vote for you.
Like, what are my skills?
Well, you have a sweet bike...
and you're really good at hookin'up with chicks.
Plus you're, like, the only guy at school who has a mustache.
That's true.
If you need to use any of my skills, I can do whatever you want.
Thanks.
If I win, you can be my secretary or something.
Sweet!
Plus I could be your bodyguard too.
Or, like, Secret Service captain or...
whatever.
Okay.
Is that yours?
Don't touch it.
It's Uncle Rico's.
What's it for?
It's a time machine, Napoleon.
He bought it online.
Yeah, right.
It works, Napoleon.
You don't even know.
Have you guys tried it yet?
No.
So, are you ready?
Yeah.
Hold on.
I forgot to put in the crystals.
Okay, turn it on.
Kill...
the pow...
Kill...
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
It's a piece of crap.
It doesn't work.
Well, I could've told you that.
l-I said the pack, not the pack.
You're just gonna have to mix and match.
Shut up.
Say it so the whole world can hear.
Well, put it back.
Napoleon, you know we can't afford the fun pack.
You think money grows on trees in this family?
Take it back.
Get some Pampers for you and your brother while you're at it.
We can use a little of this.
I can tell you that.
We can use those.
The defect in that one is bleach.
That's correct.
Yes!
This tastes like the cow got into an onion patch.
Correct.
Yes!
They're pretty good except for one little problem.
That little guy right there, he has nipple number five.
A good dairy cow should have, like, four.
Well done.
Vote for Summer.
Vote for Summer.
Vote for Summer.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Vote for Summer.
Hi.
Vote for Summer.
Hi, ladies.
Vote for Summer.
You guys voting?
Do you think it's kinda warm in here?
No.
I think it's...
They have the heater on or something.
It seems pretty good to me.
You don't feel like your head is burning or...
or anything?
No.
I'm gonna go home and lay down.
Okay.
See ya.
Vote for Summer.
Yeah, right.
I'm not votin'for her.
Then who are you gonna vote for?
I'm votin'for Pedro Sanchez.
Who do you think?
Hey, Don, can I have one of those buttons?
Hey.
Vote for Summer.
Hi.
Vote for Summer.
So, that guy in Florida give you your money back yet?
Oh, I wrote him an e-mail, sayin'I'm gonna contact the authorities...
if I don't get a refund in full.
Don't you ever wish you could go back...
with all the knowledge you have now?
Tsk.
I guess so.
Well, I'll tell you somethin'right now.
You'd find your soul mate.
I've already got a soul mate.
Oh, yeah.
What's her name again?
Lafawnduh.
Lafawnduh.
Huh.
How's she doin'?
Well, I think I'm gonna need some time off.
She's flyin'out from Detroit for a few days.
Well, what about work?
Well, haven't...
haven't you studied up on the new product?
Yes.
Well, do you know it backwards and front?
Basically.
Why don't you sell some to that girlfriend of yours?
You might as well do somethin' while you're doin'nothin'.
Because she doesn't need any.
That's why.
Hey.
I did some drawings for the flyers.
Thanks.
Why do you got your hood on like that?
Well, when I came home from school, my head started to get really hot.
So I drank some cold water, but it didn't do nothing.
So I laid in the bathtub for a while...
but then I realized that it was my hair that was making my head so hot.
So I went into my kitchen, and I shaved it all off.
I don't want anyone to see.
I know what you mean.
There's just so many options.
That one's good.
Looks like a medieval warrior.
You know, you're right.
That's a good one.
Sorry.
I think this matches your season, Pedro.
Thank you.
Vote for Pedro.
Vote for Pedro.
Vote for Pedro.
Vote for Pedro.
Vote for me.
Vote for Pedro.

Vote for Pedro.
Vote for Pedro.

Pedro.
Hey, give me cents so I can buy a pop.
I don't have any, Randy.
Come on.
I'll pay you back.
I don't have...
Stop.
Don't.
Stop.
Stop.
I'll do this to you.
Don't.
Ow.
Here.
Here.
How's your neck?
Stings.
That's too bad.
Pedro offers you his protection.
Hey, let me borrow your bike.
No.
Come on.
I'll give you some chips.
No.
Like a wash, and then you blow-dry it with bleach.
Yeah.
It's so cool.
Hey, you Trisha?
Yeah.
You remember me?
I'm a friend of your mom's.
I'm...
I'm Napoleon's uncle.
Uncle Rico.
Oh.
Yeah.
Hey, could you do me a favor?
Could you give your mom a couple of these...
and tell 'em to hand 'em out to her friends or whoever?
'Kay.
You girls give me a call if you feel like you could use some.
Have a nice day.
Why the heck you throwin' crap at my van, Napoleon?
Everybody at school thinks I'm a freakin'idiot 'cause of you.
You're gonna clean my van...
right now.
Get off of me, you "bodaggit." Higher.
No, no, higher.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Hit it.!
Dang.
Look, Pedro.
I don't know how they do things down in Juarez...
but here in Idaho we have a little something called pride.
Understand?
Smashing in the face of a piñata that resembles Summer Wheatly...
is a disgrace to you, me and the entire Gem State.
[PopSynthesizer, Drum Machine On TV] Welcome to D-Qwon's Dance Grooves.
Are you ready to get your groove on?
Yes.
All right, then.
Let's get started.
Are you disqualified?
No.
They just made me take down the flyers as a penalty for the piñatas.
Can you still run for president?
Yes.
I don't understand.
He say...
you're not allowed to smash piñatas that look like real people.
But we do it in Mexico all the time.
Your hair looked great today.
Thank you.
All right.
See you tomorrow, Pedro.
Who are you?
I'm Lafawnduh.
What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for Kip.
Kip?
Why are you so sweaty?
I been practicing.
Mmm.
Practicing what?
Some dance moves.
You like dancing?
My chores are done.
So, you ready, Lafawnduh?
I am, honey.
Sorry, Napoleon.
We're just runnin' a little bit late for some prime rib.
Tell Uncle Rico not to wait up for me.
Here.
You might like that.
My cousin made it.
I'll be waitin'outside for you, baby.
Bye, Napoleon.
See ya.
Lafawnduh is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
I'm a hundred percent positive that she's my soul mate.
Napoleon, I'm sure there's a babe out there for you too.
Peace out.
See ya.
Is this what you were looking for?
Nah, I was thinkin'of somethin' a little more...
soft around the edges.
Hmm.
Well...
I have a nice, soft pink sheet I could hang...
and I could wrap you in some foam or...
something billowy?
Yeah, billowy's good.
It'd be really nice...
if I could get the fan going.
I could hang some tinsel from the top.
You know, Deborah, you have...
striking features.
Such a soft face should be complimented with a...
soft body.
Mr Rico?
My friends and clients, they call me "Uncle Rico." What are you doing?
Shh.
Don't say another word.
Napoleon told me you'd be interested.
Napoleon?
You stop wishin', and call me when you're ready.
Hello?
Napoleon?
Yeah.
Who's this?
It's Deb...
and I'm calling to let you know I think you're a shallow friend.
What the heck are you even talkin'about?
Don't lie, Napoleon.
Your Uncle Rico made it very clear how you feel about me.
What?
I don't need herbal enhancers to feel good about myself.
And if you're so concerned about that, why don't you try eating some yourself?
Right on.
Grandma just called and said you're supposed to go home.
She didn't tell me anything.
Too bad.
She says she doesn't want you here...
when she gets back because you've been ruining everybody's lives and eatin'all our steak.
I'm not goin'anywhere, Napoleon.
Get off my property!
It's a free country.
I can do whatever I want.
Get off my property, or I'll call the cops on you.
Well, then do it.
Go on.
Maybe I will.
Gosh!
Hello?
Pedro?
How's it goin'?
Good.
Deb just called me.
She pretty much hates me by now.
Why?
'Cause my Uncle Rico's an idiot!
Do you have anything to give to her?
No, not unless she likes fish.
Are you still gonna give your speech tomorrow?
Yes.
Do you already know what you're gonna say?
Yes...
but not all of it.
Just tell 'em that...
their wildest dreams will come true if they vote for you.
I'll see you tomorrow, Pedro.
Dang it.!
What do you think you're doing?
Now, if you look right here, we have SallyJohnson from Manitou, Colorado.
Would you like to read her testimonial right there?
Sure.
Um...
"After using Bust Must Plus, I have such big bosoms..." I don't feel comfortable reading this.
Oh, that's fine.
That's fine.
But do you feel comfortable with me?
You could be...
somewhere around, uh...
here.
Come here, boy.!
Well, I never thought I would make it here today.
I would be a great class president because...
I promise to put two new pop machines in the cafeteria, and...
I'm also gonna get a glitter Bonnebell dispenser for all the girls'bathrooms.
Oh, we're gonna get new cheerleading uniforms.
Anyway, I think I'd be a great class president, so, uh...
who wants to eat "chimini-changas"next year?
Not me.
See, with me, it will be summer all year long.
Vote for Summer.
And now Summer will perform her skit with members of our very own Happy Hands Club.
Your speech is up next.
Your skit had better be pretty good.
A skit?
You perform a skit after your speech, Pedro.
What?
A flippin'skit?
Why didn't anybody tell us about this?
I don't want to be president anyway.
Pedro, just listen to your heart.
That's what I do.
I'll just tell them that I have nothing to say.
Hello.
I don't have much to say.
But I think it would be good to have some holy santos brought to the high school...
to guard the hallway and to bring us good luck.
El Santo Niño de Atocha is a good one.
My Aunt Concha has seen him.
And...
we have a great F.F.A.
schedule lined up...
and I'd like to see more of that.
If you vote for me, all of your wildest dreams will come true.
Thank you.
Up next, I hope you'll enjoy a skit by Pedro Sanchez.
Oh.
I caught you a delicious bass.
You wanna play me?
I, uh, would like to give you this advice.
And a fella give me some years ago.
He said, "When an argument arises...
"if you go outside and take, uh, a nice walk...
"you'll calm down and then you can come back and it won't be an argument.
'And you'll find that helps your health.
All that fresh air and exercise will do you a lot of good." Is there anything else you'd like to ask about?
Pedro.
Where the heck's Napoleon?
I don't know.
Lafawnduh Lucas, do you take Kipland Ronald Dynamite...
to be your lawful wedded husband...
to honor in sickness and health till death do you part?
I do.
Kipland Ronald Dynamite...
do you take Lafawnduh Lucas to be your lawful wedded wife...
in sickness and health till death do you part?
You know I do.
By the authority vested in me, I pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Why do you love me Why do you need me Always and forever We met in a chat room Now our love can fully bloom Sure the World Wide Web is great But you, you make me "salvivate" Yes, I love technology But not as much as you, you see But I still love technology Always and forever Our love is like a flock of doves Flying up to heaven above Always and forever Always and forever Yes, our love is truly great Always and forever Why do you need me Why do you love me...
Sorry I'm late.
I just got done taming a wild honeymoon stallion for you guys.
Hmm.
Hey, Deb, can you take a photo of me on the horse real quick?
Sure.
Thanks.
I hope your guys's experiences are unforgettable.
Hmm.
Lookee, lookee.
A little keepsake for you guys.
Don't forget to tell Uncle Louie I left the red wine and Parmesan in the fridge.
I love you.
Bye-bye.
'Bye, Judy.
Send me a picture.
I'll be back soon.
Don't worry about it.
Be careful, now.
'Bye.
Take it easy, now.
'Bye.
"California, here we come" What's wrong?
Don't you like my singing?
I don't like the song.
You're going to love California.
You get up in the morning...
...roll out of bed, plop, in the pool.
Yeah, sure.
You'll see.
This isn't exactly a dump we're moving to.
Push, Daniel.
Give it all you've got, kid.
Push!
Okay, we've got it.
Come on.
Get in, hurry up.
We did it again.
Way to go!
Daniel, wake up.
Look off the starboard bow.
Paradise at last.
We made it.
Come on.
This is it.
This is the end of the line.
You're telling me.
Come on.
All hands on deck.
We've got to get this thing unloaded before it sinks.
Look at those palm trees!
Damn, do you know what that means?
Yeah, watch out for falling coconuts.
Wise guy.
No more Newark winters.
I like winters.
Oh, you like sore throats?
You like frozen toes?
I don't like smog.
Did I tell you about the pool here?
About times.
Okay, so make it .
Open your eyes, my darling son.
This is the Garden of Eden.
Come on.
Listen, we're in apartment okay?
One flight up.
Are you okay?
Don't worry about it.
Let me help you up.
Thanks.
I shouldn't have done that.
It was stupid.
You must be the new people in right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Freddy Fernandez, apartment .
Daniel LaRusso.
How you doing?
Let me help.
No, it's fine.
It's heavy, man.
I got it.
Where are you from?
New Jersey.
What are you doing out here?
My mom got a job with some company out here.
Rocket Computers.
Flight of the Future.
I don't know.
I never heard of it.
It's up and coming.
Is this the only pool you've got?
That's it.
What was that, karate?
Yeah.
Have you been doing it long?
Yeah, a while.
Did you ever use it?
A couple of times.
I bet you could kick some ass.
I'd like to learn that.
Maybe you could teach me.
Sure.
That's cool.
Anytime.
Great.
This place is a dump.
You should go back to New Jersey.
How did you know where I was from?
'Cause I'm from New Jersey.
I got a nose for my own.
Well what part?
Parsippany.
I never should've left.
My Uncle Louie's from Parsippany.
Louie Martini?
Louie LaRusso.
Louie LaRusso?
Don't know him.
Hey, pup.
How you doing?
You thirsty?
She's crazy.
What?
She's not playing with a full deck.
She's nice.
What are you doing tomorrow?
I don't know.
I guess nothing.
We're having a beach party.
Want to come?
Sure, that's cool.
I'll come get you in the morning.
Here's apartment .
Is it?
Should I leave this here?
Yeah, thanks for the help.
No problem.
Nice meeting you.
Take care.
See you tomorrow morning.
Don't say anything about the pool.
I'll call first thing in the morning.
Did you tell that old lady where we were from?
Yes.
Didn't she remind you of Aunt Tessy?
More like Uncle Louie.
I really think we're going to do good here.
I have a very positive feeling.
I'm telling you, Daniel.
I just know it's going to work.
The faucet's broken.
The real estate lady said there's a fix-it guy.
See if you can find him.
What's that for?
Uncle Louie's dog.
He's cute.
I got invited to a party tomorrow.
Great.
You see?
But you wanted me to help you unpack.
I don't remember saying that.
I must have had you mixed up with somebody else.
Thanks, Ma.
Could you tell me where the maintenance guy is?
Hey, pup.
You go in through there, turn left, not too far...
...then right, go inside, and you'll find him on the left.
So I go right then left?
No, left then right, then inside on the left.
Hello?
Are you the maintenance man?
We're the new people in apartment .
The faucet's really leaking there.
Could you come fix it?
Can I tell my mom when?
When what?
When you're going to fix the faucet.
After.
After what?
After after!
Could we have the ball, please?
Pretty good.
Show-off.
Sorry.
Hey, wait up.
Who's that blonde in the blue?
The hills.
What's the hills?
Rich.
I think the blonde is looking at you.
Yeah, right.
I think she has the hots for you.
Who could blame her?
Why don't you make a move?
No, I'm eating, man.
How can you think about eating?
I'm hungry.
Maybe they ain't got no moves in Jersey.
I got moves where I come from.
We've got more moves back there than here, I'll tell you that much.
Let's see 'em.
Come on, buddy.
Go get her.
I'm going.
Lose something?
I hope we're not bothering you.
Hey, how do you juggle?
It's pretty easy.
You start on the knee.
You just go one.
One at a time.
Then you try two.
One, two.
And then three and four.
Try it.
Just bring your leg up.
Good!
That was awesome!
Brew time.
Who's for a warm one?
No, I pass.
Who are you kidding?
You're the ace degenerate.
Ex-degenerate.
Tomorrow I'm a senior.
I've got one year to make it all work.
And that's what I'm gonna do.
Make it work, all of it.
You must be a trendsetter, Johnny.
Everyone's doing something new.
Take a right.
Check it out.
Forget it, man.
It's ancient history.
Who told you, man?
I thought they broke up.
She did, he didn't.
Come on, try it.
Watch this.
I'll get it.
I'll be right back.
Ali, I want to talk to you.
Leave me alone.
We've been over all this.
I don't want to talk.
I want to talk to you, all right?
What is your problem?
Just get out of here.
That won't solve anything.
Give me my radio.
I said, give me my radio.
You promise you'll talk to me?
Yes, give me my radio.
You just broke my radio!
Yeah.
Don't touch it, punk.
What's going on?
You want it?
Johnny, stop it.
Stop it.
I didn't do anything.
You're a big man now, huh?
You started this.
I just wanted to talk.
Leave him alone and we'll talk.
Where did I hear that before?
How about you, hero?
Had enough?
Now we're even.
No mercy, man.
Why don't you hit me?
It's your fault!
It's not.
It's your fault.
Ever think it's yours?
Why do you always have to fight?
Bullshit.
Get on your bikes, guys.
You sure pick cool people to be friends with.
Where'd you find this guy?
Come on, let's go.
He'll be all right.
Are you okay?
Just leave me alone.
I'll help you.
Leave me alone.
I'm okay.
Come on, Ali.
Let's go.
It's better if you leave him alone.
Come on, let's go.
Daniel!
How was the party?
It was okay.
Must have been more than okay.
I didn't hear you come in.
Any friend material?
Some.
I got to go.
Eat first.
I'm not hungry.
You need energy to be charming.
I'm fine, I got energy.
Do me a favour.
Take off the glasses.
Why?
Because I asked you to.
It's California.
It's the look.
I want to see your baby browns.
Come on with the baby browns.
Are you on something?
I'm on Minute Maid.
Why hide your eyes?
I'm not.
Take off the glasses.
Now!
My God!
How did that happen?
I hit a kerb with my bike.
I wore the glasses so you wouldn't worry.
It looks worse than it feels.
Don't do that.
It doesn't hurt.
Can you see?
You want to stay home?
I've got to go.
Hey, you guys, Freddy, how you doing?
Hey, the karate kid.
Let's see the moves.
He knows how to get his butt kicked.
I already know that move.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, think fast.
Hi.
Hi, how are you doing?
Your eye.
It looks worse than it feels.
Believe me.
I hope so.
I never got a chance to thank you.
That was nothing.
I'm just sorry about your radio.
I'm more sorry about your eye.
You should've just given it to him.
Why?
It wasn't his, right?
Yeah, it wasn't his.
We think alike already.
You know what else we do alike?
You've been practicing.
Cheerleaders, over here.
I've got to go.
I'll see you.
'Bye.
Hey, have you got a name?
Ali with an "i." What's your name?
Daniel with an "I." I'll see you later.
Definitely.
Get him, Bobby.
Have a nice trip?
Look what he's doing to Bobby.
Nobody hits me.
I'm going to kill him.
None of that on this team!
He hooked me!
I said out of here!
Back to it.
Let's go.
This school sucks!
It sucks.
...
...
Fix faucet.
Come on in.
It's the kitchen one.
...
Karate.
Yeah, ...
Very good.
Learn from book?
And a few months at the Y in Newark.
...
...
...
What happened to eye?
I fell off my bike.
Lucky no hurt hand.
Ali with an "i." How are you doing?
Good.
Not too hungry today?
Not really.
Have some pie, I made it myself.
How do you like the valley?
It hasn't been dull.
Was Newark dull?
How did you know I was from there?
I asked.
Oh, really?
Are you sitting with anybody?
With you, if it's okay.
Sounds great to me.
Want some milk?
Thanks.
Sorry about the soccer tryouts.
Those are the breaks.
Remember that guy you had trouble with on the beach?
Yeah, King Karate?
He's my ex-boyfriend.
That's good to know.
What?
Yeah, you're right.
I know.
What are you doing?
It's this little voice...
...telling me I've got to be nuts to be talking to you.
That'll be $ .
.
For both.
$ .
.
It doesn't matter, anyway.
Why's that?
Because it's over.
Wait.
How over?
Weeks.
One week, five weeks?
How many weeks is "weeks"?
Fear does not exist in this dojo .
Does it?
No, Sensei!
Pain does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?
No, Sensei!
Defeat doesn't exist in this dojo .
Does it?
No, Sensei!
Fear does not exist in this dojo .
Does it?
No, Sensei!
Pain does not exist in this dojo.
Does it?
No, Sensei!
Defeat doesn't exist in this dojo .
Does it?
No, Sensei!
Prepare.
What do we study here?
The way of the fist, sir!
And what is that way?
Strike first, strike hard, no mercy!
I can't hear you.
Strike first, strike hard, no mercy!
Mr Lawrence.
Yes, Sensei .
Warm them up.
Fighting positions.
Jab punch.
Ready.
Guess what.
I'm going to be trained as a manager.
Isn't that great?
The programme's two nights a week.
As soon as a spot opens up, I'm in.
The benefits are great.
They pay for everything.
That's great.
What's the matter, Daniel?
Nothing.
Remember when you went to the country and hated it 'cause you had no friends?
What happened?
I got poison ivy.
You met Kevin and Kenny, who became your best friends in the world.
You've got to give it a try.
I know it's hard.
We're not quitters, are we?
I guess not.
What's with the karate place?
It sucks.
Good.
We couldn't afford it anyway.
And the girl situation?
It's okay.
Just okay?
To me it looks like the whole world turned blonde.
You got your eye on anybody?
Cute?
Not cute.
She's beyond cute.
But she's blonde, right?
She's got blonde hair.
Lucille, let's go, here they come.
Is she as pretty as Judy?
She buries Judy in a second.
She buries Judy?
Tell me about it later.
I love you.
Careful how you ride home.
She's got an excellent smile.
She's really smart.
I'd say she's beautiful.
I think she's beautiful.
I think she's something else.
She's hot.
Definitely hot.
Looking for a shortcut to Newark?
He wants to learn karate.
Here's the first lesson: How to take a fall.
Don't think about the pain.
Damn bike!
I hate this bike!
I hate this frigging bike!
Stupid bike!
What's the matter?
Why did you throw your bike away?
Because I felt like it.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
My God!
Tell me what's going on.
Don't say another bike accident.
What do you want to hear?
The truth.
No, all you want to hear is how great it is here.
Maybe for you, but it sucks for me.
I hate this place!
I hate it, I want to go home!
Why can't we just go back home?
Listen to me.
I cannot help you unless you tell me what's wrong.
I've got to take karate.
You took karate.
Not at the Y, at a good school.
Fighting doesn't solve anything.
Neither does palm trees.
That's not fair.
It wasn't fair coming out here without asking me.
You're right.
I should've asked.
I just want to go home.
I don't understand the rules here.
Let's see if we can figure out the rules together.
What about your bike?
It's safer taking the bus.
Why can't we just go home and forget this place?
I'll tell you everything he said.
You'd better.
How are you?
What happened to your forehead?
It's terrible.
A gigantic runaway zit.
That's gross.
Daniel, this is Susan.
What really happened?
I got in a bike accident.
What kind of bike do you have?
A Honda?
Suzuki?
It's a Miyagi Turbo.
Yeah?
Oh, really?
We're going to the arcade.
Want to come?
Sounds great.
There's this new game I want to show you.
I forgot something.
I'll catch up with you guys in a minute.
Don't run away.
I'm not running away from anything.
We've got to deal with this.
I'll deal with it my own way.
Daniel...
Get off my case!
Did you fix my bike?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I really appreciate that.
Are those real trees?
You like see, come inside.
Thanks.
How did they get so small?
I train.
Clip here, tie there.
Did you learn this in Japan?
Okinawa.
Where's that?
My country.
China here.
Japan here.
Okinawa here.
Did you go to school for this?
Father teach.
Was he a gardener?
Fisherman.
A fisherman.
These are really beautiful.
Come, you try.
I don't know how to do this stuff.
Sit down.
I may mess it up or something.
Close eyes.
Trust.
Concentrate.
Think only tree.
Make a perfect picture down to last pine needle.
Wipe your mind clean.
Everything but the tree.
Nothing exists in whole world...
...only tree.
You got it?
Open eyes.
Remember picture?
Yeah.
Make like picture.
Just trust the picture.
How do I know my picture's the right one?
If come from inside you, always the right one.
Hi.
Hi, Ma, come on in.
You fixed your bike.
Mr Miyagi fixed it.
Great, thank you.
How much do we owe you?
No, please.
My pleasure.
That's very nice.
Hi, champ.
Hey.
What are you doing?
I'm trimming my baby tree.
Bonsai tree.
Bonsai tree.
Bonsai.
Bonsai.
They're beautiful.
Mr Miyagi learned it in Okinawa.
That's where he's from.
Really?
They're so delicate.
For me?
No, I couldn't.
Please, hurt feelings.
That's very nice, thank you.
Welcome.
I know just where it will go.
Come on, it's getting late.
I'll be up in a half hour.
No, now.
School tomorrow.
Thank you for everything.
You're welcome.
Don't forget tree.
Must practice.
Thank you.
Sayonara.
Sayonara.
Goodnight.
Thanks again.
See you.
Ma, he gave you the nicest one.
This guy is something else.
You saw what he did to my bike.
This guy is great.
Happy Halloween.
You like?
Yeah, that's nice.
Passed school today.
Lots happening.
What's the matter?
You're not going?
No.
How come?
I'm not into dancing that much.
I don't feel like it, anyway.
You're too much by self.
Not good.
I'm not by myself.
I'm with you.
To make honey, young bee need young flower, not old prune.
I don't have a costume, anyway.
If have costume...
...you go?
If I went as the Invisible Man.
Invisible Man?
You know, so no one would see me.
There's Daniel.
Where?
In the shower.
How do you know?
I just know.
May I?
I don't know what she sees in him.
She must be into fungus.
Help me, my flower needs water.
You've come to the right place, stranger.
I've never danced in a shower.
A friend of mine made this for me.
Isn't it great?
Where have you been hiding?
I haven't been hiding.
I haven't seen you around.
You been looking?
Sort of.
Sort of?
I thought you were still angry with me.
Why?
Because of what I said last time I saw you.
I've been thinking a lot about that.
I should learn to mind my own business.
No, I think you're right about facing things.
I feel the same way.
I just kind of forgot for a while.
Thanks for reminding me.
You're welcome.
He thinks he can do whatever he wants to people.
Who?
Johnny.
I'd love to see him get some of his own medicine.
What goes around comes around.
I'd love to be there when it does.
Me, too.
You want to go outside?
You talked me into it.
That chicken is wild!
That guy's using real eggs!
He's great!
No!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Got that number rolled?
In a minute.
I'm going to get the guys.
Hurry up.
Shit!
Move, man!
Johnny, what's up?
Get out of my way!
What's wrong?
It's coming around.
Get up!
Get out of my way!
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of the way!
You ain't going nowhere.
You little wimp!
You couldn't leave well enough alone, could you, little twerp?
No, you had to push it.
Well, now you're gonna pay!
Where are you going, sweetheart?
How about a front kick, Johnny?
Get him up.
He's had enough.
Shut up!
He can't even stand up.
That don't mean squat.
Johnny, he's had enough.
I'll decide when he's had enough.
What's wrong with you, Johnny?
An enemy deserves no mercy.
Right!
You're crazy, man!
Get him!
Danielsan .
Come.
Leave on.
It stinks.
What is it?
Smell bad, heal good.
Where did Spider-Man go?
Who?
The guy who bailed me out.
Where'd he go?
What, you?
No way.
Why "no way"?
Because...
Because, old man?
Have tea.
Feel better.
Why didn't you tell me?
Tell you what?
That you do karate.
You never ask.
Where'd you learn it?
Father.
I thought he was a fisherman.
In Okinawa, all Miyagi know two things: Fish and karate.
Karate come from China, th century.
Called " te ," hand.
Much later...
...Miyagi ancestors call "karate," empty hand.
I always thought it came from Buddhist temples.
You, too much TV.
That's what my mother tells me.
Have you ever taught anyone?
No.
Would you?
It depend.
On what?
Reason.
How's revenge?
You look for revenge that way, start by digging two graves.
At least I'd have company, right?
Fighting always last answer to problem.
Mr Miyagi, I don't think you understand my problem.
Miyagi understand problem perfect.
Your friend all karate student?
Friends?
Yeah, those guys.
Problem attitude.
The problem is I keep getting my ass kicked.
Because boys have bad attitude.
Karate for defence only.
That's not what these guys are taught.
I can see.
No such thing bad student, only bad teacher.
Teacher say, student do.
Great, that solves everything.
I'll go to the school and straighten it out with the teacher.
Now use head for something other than target.
I was only kidding.
Why kidding?
I get killed if I show up there.
Get killed anyway.
Would you go with me?
No, I can't.
Why?
You said it was a good idea.
For you, good idea.
For me, good idea no get involved.
But you're already involved.
Very sorry.
What?
Thanks for nothing then.
Like I didn't have enough problems already.
Now I've got to carry your weight, too.
Don't do me any more favours.
Danielsan .
What?
Okay, I go.
Excellent, Mr Miyagi.
Miyagi.
Miyagi.
What kind of belt do you have?
Canvas.
You like?
J.C.
Penney.
$ .
.
I meant...
In Okinawa a belt means no need rope hold up pants.
That's funny.
Danielsan .
What?
Karate here.
Karate here.
Karate never here.
You understand?
I think so.
Goodnight, Danielsan .
Goodnight, Mr Miyagi.
Miyagi!
Tomorrow morning?
: .
Thanks for helping me out with my friends out there.
Good morning, Mr Miyagi.
How do you feel?
A little sore.
You know how drive?
Yeah, I do.
No, I'm not very good at it.
Me neither.
I don't have a licence.
Me neither.
I guess it's okay then.
You lose concentration in a fight and you're dead meat!
Yes, Sensei .
What?
Yes, Sensei!
Get up!
Give me pushups on your knuckles.
Combat!
Brown.
Robertson.
On guard.
Point.
Round kick.
What are you looking at?
Finish him!
Return.
Prepare.
We do not train to be merciful, here.
Mercy is for the weak.
Here, on the street, in competition...
...a man confronts you, he is the enemy.
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr Lawrence?
Come on, let's forget this.
Wait, not yet.
Class, we have visitors.
Fall in behind me.
I hear you jumped some of my students last night.
Afraid the facts mixed up.
Are you calling him a liar?
No call no one nothing.
What are you here for, old man?
Come ask leave boy alone.
Can't the boy take care of himself?
One-to-one problem, yes.
Five-to-one problem, too much ask anyone.
Is that what's bothering you, the odds?
Well, we can fix that.
Feel like matching, Mr Lawrence?
Yes, Sensei!
No more fighting.
This is a karate dojo , not a knitting class.
You don't come in here, drop a challenge and leave, old man.
You get your boy on the mat, or you and I will have a problem.
Too much advantage, your dojo .
Name a place.
Tournament.
You've got real nerve, old man.
But I think we can accommodate you.
Can't we, Mr Lawrence?
Yes, Sensei .
Fall in.
Ask one more small request.
Make it fast.
Ask leave boy alone to train.
You're a pushy little bastard, ain't you?
But I like that.
No one touches the prima donna until the tournament.
Is that understood?
Yes, Sensei!
But if you don't show...
...then it's open season...
...on him...
...and you.
I can't believe this.
I cannot believe this!
What?
What you just got me into.
You said you'd make things better.
I did.
How?
How?
I saved you two months of beating.
Great, now I've got something to look forward to.
How much further is your house?
Other side tracks.
Are you in the oil business, too?
Not everything is as seem.
Reminds me of Newark.
What are we going to do here?
Start training.
Much work be done.
Tournament here before you know it.
That's what I'm afraid of.
That teacher was really wacko.
You really think I can beat that guy?
No matter.
Wacko teacher attitude rest in fist.
Stupid, but fact of life.
Win, lose, no matter.
You make good fight, earn respect.
Then nobody bother.
They'll bury me where I fall.
Either way, problem solved.
Wait right here.
This is great.
I forgot to give you this back.
You keep.
Thanks a lot.
Ready?
Yeah, I guess so.
Danielsan , must talk.
Walk on road.
Walk right side, safe.
Walk left side, safe.
Walk middle, sooner or later, you get squished just like grape.
Here, karate same thing.
Either you karate do, yes, or karate do, no.
You karate do, "guess so," just like grape.
Understand?
Yeah, I understand.
Ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Yes.
First make sacred pact.
I promise teach karate.
That's my part.
You promise learn.
I say, you do, no questions.
That's your part.
Deal?
It's a deal.
First wash all the cars, then wax.
Why do I have to...
Remember deal.
No questions.
Yeah, but...
Wax on right hand.
Wax off left hand.
Wax on, wax off.
Breathe in through nose, out through mouth.
Wax on, wax off.
Don't forget to breathe.
Very important.
Wax on, wax off.
Wax on, wax off.
Where did these cars come from?
Detroit.
Wax on...
...right hand make circle.
Wax off, left hand make circle.
Wax on, wax off.
Breathe in, breathe out.
Wax on, wax off.
Mr Miyagi, I'm finished.
You want to check these out?
Mr Miyagi?
Mr Miyagi?
Hello?
I've been looking all over for you.
Where've you been?
I don't believe it.
What?
Where are you going?
I'm going to find that idiot.
No, it's been taken care of.
Until next time.
There isn't going to be a "next time." There they are.
Watch this.
Hey, guys, it's good to see you.
Sorry about your eye, Johnny.
Your shoulder okay, Tommy?
You guys be careful not to step in front of any more buses.
Hold it.
Remember what Sensei said?
Wait for the tournament.
It must be "Take a Worm for a Walk" week.
You did all that damage?
When you make a wish in the shower, it always comes true.
I should have kept my mouth shut.
No, we've got an agreement.
Yeah?
What's that?
They agreed not to beat up on me and I promised not to bleed on them.
I don't believe you.
What can I do, moan and groan?
Anybody else would.
Who'd listen anyway?
Me.
Really?
You feel like listening on Saturday night?
Sure.
Great!
So Saturday night...
...we'll go out, we'll have a good time.
We'll do whatever.
Is that your address?
You got it.
Where is this?
I've got to go.
Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
Great.
All right.
Mr Harris, can I talk to you?
LaRusso.
Third period history class.
I wanted to tell you, I really got a lot out of that lecture about the Indians.
I was telling my buddies about it.
Could you give us a quick review?
Sure, I'm free this period.
Great for me.
No, I got to go.
I guess that leaves you and me, but that's all right.
You can tell them about it later.
The Plains Indians were a very primitive tribe...
Come on, Casanova.
Hi, how are you doing?
Good.
You look nice.
Thank you.
You've got company.
Those are my parents.
Come on, I want you to meet them.
Great.
Hello, sweetheart.
Hi, Dad.
This is Daniel LaRusso.
My parents, Mr And Mrs Mills.
How do you do, Daniel?
Hello, Daniel.
Nice to meet you.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Where are we going?
I don't know.
Wherever you want.
Golf N'Stuff?
We're going to Golf N'Stuff, then.
Don't worry about that.
Weren't you going to have that fixed?
I am.
I was.
I will.
You live in Encino, Daniel?
Encino?
No.
Where do you live?
Out, like Reseda.
And that's your mother?
Yeah, that's her.
Hi!
She's waiting for us.
We'd better go.
Nice to meet you.
Not too late, sweetheart.
Okay, Dad.
Hi, Mrs LaRusso.
I'm Ali.
Hi, Ali.
Call me Lucille.
That's a beautiful house you have.
Thanks.
Can you drive a stick?
Yeah.
Put it into second, let it roll, and when I say "pop it," pop it.
"Pop it." Don't worry, it's all under control.
She's cute.
It happens a lot.
Okay, LaRusso, push!
On, you huskies!
Okay, pop it!
We got it on the first!
I'll pick you up at : .
Please, don't be late.
Have fun.
Look at that slide.
We'll do that next time.
Why next time?
You need a bathing suit.
Oh, yeah.
Bathing suits.
Do you play hockey?
Not professionally.
This is the best time I've had since I've been here.
We'll have to do it again.
Definitely.
Hey, good looking.
How are you?
Good.
This is cool.
I just got it.
You want a ride?
Some other time.
Are you sure?
Daniel, this is Eddie.
Eddie, Daniel.
How are you doing, Daniel?
Good.
Hey, Ali!
How's it going?
Hi, guys.
How are you doing?
Want to come with us?
No, I don't think so.
You guys have a good time.
We'll make room.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Your little friend can come, if it's okay with his mommy.
Hi, kids.
Hey, Mommy, can Daniel come for a ride?
I really like your car.
You could've gone.
I didn't want to.
It's no big deal.
Lf I'd wanted to go, I would have.
It makes no difference to me.
Do what you want, I don't care.
This is beautiful.
Mr Miyagi, this is great.
You've got real fish in there.
This is outrageous.
I thought Chung Lee's restaurant was nice.
You beat his act.
This is paradise.
Did you do this yourself?
Are these bongos?
No, I got it.
"Hare Krishna" Daniel-san, you much humour.
What are these?
Japanese sander.
What do you do with them?
Funny you should ask.

It'd be easier going back and forth.
But you go circle.

Good.
Go home, get rest.
Come morning, start early.

Wouldn't a fly swatter be easier?
Man who catch fly with chopsticks, accomplish anything.
Did you ever catch one?
Not yet.
Could I try?
If wish.
Hey, Mr Miyagi, look!
You, beginner luck.
I guess that means I can accomplish anything, right?

Four days I've been busting my ass, I haven't learned a thing.
You learn plenty.
I've learned to sand your decks.

Not everything is as seems.
Bullshit!

But you knew karate.
Someone always know more.
There were times when you were scared to fight?
Always scared.
Miyagi hate fighting.

Honey, you've monopolised the best-looking man here long enough.

Good, maybe you'll die.
I just wanted to apologise.
Fine, you apologised.
I got my licence.
Whoop-dee-doo.
What's with you?
What do you expect?
Cartwheels?
I just expected some courtesy, or is that only for people with fancy cars?
Can't you take a hint?
Does the truth hurt?
You really think that's it?
I know it is.
You're wrong.
I bet I'm wrong.
I didn't go out with you because of a car or where you live.
Okay, while we're on the subject, why did you then?
Why did you?
I thought maybe you and me were different.
I'm from Reseda, you're from the hills, that's how we're different.
Admit that you just can't handle the situation the way it is.
I can handle it fine.
You can't.
What makes you so sensitive?
She's never been anything but nice to you.
She used me to make him jealous.
She doesn't even like him.
Who could tell, the way their faces were stuck together at the country club?
Right, you didn't stick around for the exciting conclusion.
What, his hand on her ass?
Her right hook.
You think she sprained her wrist doing her nails?
She hit him?
That's an understatement.
Why didn't she say something?
She shouldn't have to, should she?
Hey, slugger.
Look, I'm a jerk.
You are a jerk.
So, am I forgiven?
I don't hear anything.
Sounds like a "yes" to me.
Come here.
I guess you know about the tournament tomorrow.
Who doesn't?
Dumb move, huh?
Not necessarily.
I don't have much of a cheering section.
You got me.
I'll probably get killed in the first match.
So, we'll leave early.
I've got something to show you.
What?
How do you like it?
Is it yours?
Are you serious?
It's beautiful.
It sure is.
My God.
Here you go.
You want me to drive?
It's the ' s!
To start, you push that button.
You're incredible.
Press the clutch.
Get the lights, no that one.
Good.
Down is first.
Let it out slow.
Hold on!
This is awesome.
How fast does it go?
Let's not find out.
What belt are you?
Why matter?
This is open division, it's only for brown belt or above.
Boy black belt.
You'd better hustle.
They're starting.
Down the hall, to your left.
I'll see you inside.
Okay.
Excuse me, Mr Referee.
This is not "Miyaji." Miyagi.
Miyagi.
Okay, thank you.
Well, look who we have here.
Our little friend Danielle.
Hello, Danielle.
What's the matter?
Mommy not here to dress you?
I'm talking to you, punk.
Come on, make a move.
Hey, save it for the ring.
Come on!
All right.
Let's go.
Come on.
Points or no points...
...you're dead meat.
I said out!
Dead meat.
Way to go, I think he's gonna cry.
The winner of the first match in the open division is Rufus Schneider.
Mr Miyagi.
Hurry.
Tournament starting.
Where'd we get this?
Daniel LaRusso...
Buddha provide.
...
please report to Ring .
Where's Ring?
Over there.
Hold it!
Sorry, teachers and students only.
He doesn't speak English...
...and I can't understand his instructions without her.
She's his translator.
What did he say?
You remind him of his uncle in Tokyo.
I guess it's okay.
What?
He says you're very kind.
Thank you.
Welcome.
What are the rules here?
I don't know.
First time you, first time me.
I figured you knew about this stuff.
I figured you went to these before.
Great, I'm dead.
You told me you fought a lot.
For life, not for points.
Everything above your waist is a point.
You can hit the head, sternum, kidneys, ribs.
Got it?
I hope so.
You can do it.
When are you jerks going to grow up?
Where am I, over here at this one?
Number .
What's that guy kneeling for?
I don't know.
Don't you know anything?
Don't get hit.
Face.
Bow.
On guard.
Fight.
Back on your line.
Be tough, Daniel.
Come on, be tough.
Remember your defence.
Points coming.
Concentrate.
Focus power.
Remember balance.
Make good fight.
Run out of the ring once more, it'll cost you a point.
On guard.
Ready?
That's one, Daniel, come on.
One more!
Move back on your line.
That's one point, round kick.
Daniel, you're the best!
You're dead!
Point!
Winner!
Winner!
It must be tight.
Yeah, right there.
I never thought I'd get this far.
Make two of us.
Wouldn't it be great if I won?
It'd be great if you survive.
What do you mean "survive"?
I'm fine as long as I don't move.
You've got to move now, they're starting.
Are they starting now?
What do you mean "survive"?
Ladies and gentlemen...
...
may I have your attention, please.
This is the first semi-final match of the afternoon.
Defending champion, John Lawrence of the Cobra Kai.

Lawrence, back on the line.
Way to go!
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
One point, Lawrence.
Good point, Johnny!
Point Lawrence.
Winner!
The next semi-final determines who will face the defending champion.
Daniel LaRusso, of the Miyagi-do Karate.
Bobby...
...I want him out of commission.
Sensei, I can beat this guy.
I don't want him beaten.
But I'll be disqualified!
Out of commission.
Let's go, fellas.
Good luck.
Do what you got to do, Bobby!
Face.
Bow.
Ready?
Watch the control, gentlemen.
Ready?
I'm sorry!
I didn't mean it.
My leg!
Mr Miyagi, my leg hurts.
Miyagi here.

...
for excessive and deliberate contact.
Under rule ...
...
Daniel LaRusso has minutes to return to the ring.
If he is unable to return...
...
John Lawrence will win by default.
I'll inform the judges.
You did well out there, young man.
Damn it!
Honey, forget it.
You were great.
I couldn't be prouder.
It was just bad luck.
You would have won if they hadn't cheated.
Just leave me alone for a minute.
We'll be outside.
Mr Miyagi...
...you think I had a chance of winning?
Win, lose, no matter.
That's not what I mean.
Had good chance.
Can you fix my leg with that thing you do?
No need fight anymore.
You proved a point.
What, that I can take a beating?
Every time I see those guys, they'll know they got the best of me.
I'll never have balance that way, not with them, not with Ali...
...not with me.
What?
Close eye.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the moment we've been waiting for.
Daniel LaRusso's going to fight?
Daniel LaRusso's going to fight!
This is what it's all about, folks.

Ready?
That's okay, Johnny.
Lawrence, return.
One point, LaRusso.
You're dead.
Daniel, you've got him!
Point!
Jab!
That's two for LaRusso.
Time out.
Go to your sensei.

Come on, Daniel.
Be strong.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Whoever wins the next point will be our new champion.
Finish him, Johnny!
It's over, Johnny!
You did it!
Are you okay?
Can you go on?
Get him a body bag!
Warning for illegal contact to the knee.
Finish him!
Winner!
The new champion!
You're all right, LaRusso.
Thanks a lot.
Mr Miyagi, we did it.
Do you find me sadistic?
You know, I bet I could fry an egg on your head right now.
If I wanted to.
You know, kiddo...
I'd like to believe you're aware enough, even now, to know that there is nothing sadistic in my actions.
Maybe towards those other jokers.
But not you.
No, kiddo.
At this moment...
This is me..
...at my most masochistic.
Bill...
It's your baby.
Coming!
Sarah, cannot believe you are early.
What you going to do now, huh?!
What you got?!
Got your ass.
Wrap it up!
Come on!
Okay.
Come on, bitch.
Come on.
Bring it on.
Mommy, I'm home.
Hey, baby.
How was school?
Mommy, what happened to you and the TV room?
Your good-for-nothing dog got into the living room and acted a damn fool.
That's what happened baby.
Barney did this?
Baby.
Now, you can't come in here.
There's broken glass everywhere and you could cut yourself.
This is an old friend of Mommy's I ain't seen in a long time.
Hi, honey.
I'm What's your name?
Her name is Nikki.
Nikki.
Such a pretty name for such a pretty girl.
How old are you, Nikki?
Nikki.
asked you a question.
I'm .
years old, eh?
You know, I had a little girl once.
She'd be about now.
Now baby, me and Mommy's friend got some grown-up talk to talk about.
So go in your room now and leave us alone til I tell you to come out.
Okay?
Nikkia!
ln your room.
Now.
You want some coffee?
Yeah.
Sure.
This Pasadena homemaker's name is Jeanne Bell.
Her husband is Dr Lawrence Bell.
But back when we were acquainted four years ago, her name was Vernita Green.
Her code name was Copperhead.
Mine, Black Mamba.
Do you have a towel?
Yeah.
Thanks.
You still take cream and sugar right?
Yeah.
So suppose it's a little late for an apology, huh?
You suppose correctly.
Look, bitch...
I need to know if you're going to start any more shit around my baby girl.
You can relax for now.
I'm not going to murder you in front of your child, okay?
That's being more rational than Bill led me to believe you were capable of.
lt's mercy, compassion and forgiveness I lack.
Not rationality.
Look.
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.
I wish to God I hadn't, but I did.
You have every right to want to get even.
No no, no, no, no.
No.
To get even, even-steven...
I would have to kill you...
...go up to Nikkis room, kill her...
...then wait for your husband, the good Dr Bell, to come home and kill him.
That would be even Vernita That'd be about square.
Look, if I could go back in a machine, I would.
But I can't.
All can tell you is that I'm a different person now.
Oh great.
I don't care.
Be that as it may, I know I don't deserve your mercy or your forgiveness.
However, I beseech you for both on behalf of my daughter.
Bitch, you can stop right there.
Just because I have no wish to murder you in front of your daughter...
...doesn't mean that parading her around in front of me will inspire sympathy.
You and I have unfinished business.
And not a goddamned thing you've done in the subsequent four years...
...including getting knocked up is going to change that.
So when do we do this?
It all depends.
When do you want to die?
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?
How about tonight, bitch?
Splendid.
Where?
There's a baseball diamond where I coach Litte League about a mile from here.
We meet there around : in the morning dressed all in black.
Your hair in a black stocking.
And we have us a knife fight.
We won't be bothered.
Now...
...I have to fix Nikkis cereal.
Bill always said you were one of the best ladies with an edged weapon.
Fuck you bitch.
I know he didn't qualify that shit.
So you can just kiss my motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.
Black Mamba.
I should have been mother fucking Black Mamba.
Weapon of choice?
lf you want to stick with your butcher knife, that's fine by me.
Very funny, bitch.
Very funny.
lt was not my intention to do this in front of you.
For that, I'm sorry.
But you can take my word for it.
Your mother had it coming.
When you grow up...
...if you still feel raw about it...
...I'll be waiting.
For those regarded as warriors...
...when engaged in combat...
...the vanquishing of thine enemy can be the warriors only concern.
Suppress all human emotions and compassion...
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be Lord God, or Buddha himself.
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat...
...and next, we got some record.
Very own wildman, Charlie Feathers.
We I give me the gory details, Son Number One.
lt's a goddamn massacre, Pop.
They wiped out the whole wedding party, execution-style.
Give me a figure.
Nine dead bodies.
And we're talking the whole shebang.
Bride, groom...
...reverend, reverend's wife.
Hell, they even shot that old colored fella that plays the organ.
Seems like someone objected to the union and wasn't able to hold their peace.
Good gravy, Marie.
What'd I tell you, Pop?
Looks like a goddamn Nicaraguan death squad.
You better shit-can that blasphemy boy.
You in a house of worship.
Sorry, Pop.
This is the work of professionals.
I'd guesstimate Mexican mafia hit squad.
Four, maybe five strong.
How can you tell?
Well a sure and steady hand did this.
This ain't no squirrelly amateur.
This is the work of a salty dog.
You can tell by the cleanness of the carnage.
Now a kill-crazy rampage though it may be...
...all the colors are kept inside the line.
lf you was a moron, you could almost admire it.
Who's the bride?
Don't know.
The name on the marrage certificate is Arlene Machiavelli.
That's a fake.
We've al just been calling her "The Bride" on account of the dress.
You can tell she was pregnant.
He must be a mad dog to shoot a goddamn good-looking gal like that in the head.
Look at her.
Hay-colored hair, big eyes.
She's a little blood-splattered angel.
Son Number One?
Yeah?
This tall drink of cocksucker ain't dead.
I might never have liked you.
Point in fact, I despise you.
But that shouldn't suggest that I don't respect you.
Dying in our sleep...
...is a luxury that our kind is rarely afforded.
My gift to you.
For fucks sake.
Hello Bill.
What's her condition?
Comatose.
Where is she?
I'm standing over her right now.
That's my girl.
Elle, you will abort the mission.
What?!
We owe her better than that.
Oh you don't owe her shit.
Will you keep your voice down?
You don't owe her shit!
May I say one thing?
Speak.
Y'all beat the hell out of that woman, but you didn't kill her.
And I put a bullet in her head but her heart just kept on beating.
Now you saw that your self with your own beautiful blue eye.
Did you not?
We've done a lot of things to this lady.
And if she ever wakes up, we'll do a whole lot more.
But one thing we won't do...
...is sneak into her room in the night like a filthy rat...
...and kill her in her sleep.
And the reason we won't do that thing...
...is because that thing would lower us.
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?
I guess.
Do you really have to guess?
No.
I don't really have to guess.
I know.
Come on home, honey.
Affirmative.
I love you very much.
I love you too.
Bye-bye.
Thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?
Word of advice, shithead.
Don't you ever wake up.
This moment, this is me...
...at my most masochistic.
Bill, it's your baby.
My baby.
Four years.
Four years.
Price is $ a fuck, my friend.
You getting your freak on, or what?
Oh, yeah, boy.
.
Yeah.
Now here's the rules.
Rule number one: No punching her.
Nurse comes in tomorrow and she got a shiner or less teeth, jig's up.
So no knuckle sandwiches under no circumstances.
And by the way, this cunt's a spitter.
lt's a motor reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.
We absolutely clear on rule number one?
Yeah Good.
Now, rule number two: No monkey bites, no hickeys.
In fact - no leaving no marks of no kind.
After that, it's all good, buddy.
Her plumbing don't work no more so come in her all you want.
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.
I'll be back in .
Yeah.
Oh!
Shit.
By the way, sometimes this chick's cooch can get drier than a bucket of sand.
lf she dry, just lube up with this and you'll be good to go.
Bon appètit, good buddy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, goddamn, you are the best-looking girl I've had today.
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.
I'm coming in, ready or not.
Good buddy, did you have your self a good time man?
Whoa.
Where's Bill?
Where's Bill?!
Please stop hitting me Where's Bill?
I don't know who Bill is!
Bullshit!
Well, ain't you the slice of cutie pie they said you was?
Jane Doe.
We don't know shit about you.
Well, I'm from Huntsville, Texas.
My name's Buck and I'm here to fuck.
Your name's Buck.
Right?
And you came here to fuck.
Right?
"Pussy Wagon" You fucker.
Texas.
Okay.
Wiggle your big toe.
Wiggle your big toe.
Wiggle your big toe.
Wiggle your big toe.
Wiggle your big toe.
As I lay in Buck's truck trying to will my limbs out of entropy...
Wiggle your big toe.
I saw the faces of the cunts who did this to me and the dick responsible.
Members all of Bill's brainchild.
The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.
When fortune smiles on something as violent and ugly as revenge...
...it seems proof like no other that not only does God exist...
...you're doing his will.
At a tie when I knew the least about my enemies...
...the first name on my death list, O-Ren lshii...
...was the easiest to find.
But when one manages the hard task of becoming queen of Tokyo's underworld.
...one doesn't keep it a secret, does one?
O-Ren lshii was born on an American military base in Tokyo, Japan.
The half-Japanese half Chinese-American army brat...
...made her first acquaintance with death at the age of .
lt was at that age she witnessed the death of her parents...
...at the hands of Japan's most ruthless yakuza boss.
Boss Matsumoto.
Mommy.
She swore revenge.
Luckily for her, Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.
At she got her revenge.
Look at me Matsumoto...
...take a good look at my face.
Look at my eyes.
Look at my nose.
Look at my chin.
Look at my mouth.
Do I look familiar?
Do I look like somebody you murdered.
By she was one of the top female assassins in the world.
At she did her part in the killing of nine innocent people...
...including my unborn daughter...
...in a small wedding chapel in El Paso, Texas.
But on that day four years ago...
...she made one big mistake.
She should have killed ten.
However, before satisfaction would be mine...
...first things first.
Wiggle your big toe.
Hard part's over.
Now, let's get these other piggies wiggling.
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?
Okinawa.
One-way.
Hi.
Welcome...
Welcome.
You English?
Almost.
American.
American.
Welcome, welcome.
My English very good.
You said "domo".
Can you speak Japanese?
No, no.
Just a few words I learned since yesterday.
May I sit at the bar?
Oh, sure sure sure.
Please, sit.
What other words did you learn?
Just a minute.
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.
I'm watching my soap operas.
Oh, shit.
Lazy bastard...
Screw your soap opera....
hurry up.
The teas hot.
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?
Shut up!
Get your ass out here!
Excuse me.
What other Japanese do you know?
Oh, let's see.
Good.
I already said "domo", right?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Please repeat.
Perfect.
Good, good, good.
You say Japanese word like you're Japanese.
Now you're making fun of me.
No.
Serious business.
Pronunciation very good.
You say "arigato" like we say "arigato".
Well, thank you.
I mean, ariga to.
You should learn Japanese.
Very easy.
No kidding?
I heard it was kind of hard.
Most difficult.
But, you have Japanese tongue.
Oh my God.
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea.
Hurry up...
goddamit.
Lazy bastard...
What'd ya want?
I beg your pardon?
Drink.
Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake, please.
Warm sake?
Very good.
One warm sake!
Sake?
ln the middle of the day?
Day, night afternoon Who gives a damn.
Get the sake.
How come I always have to get the sake?
You listen well...
For thirty years you make the fish.
I get the sake.
If this were the military, I'd be General by now.
Oh, so you'd be General huh?
If you were General, I'd be Emperor, and you'd still get the sake.
So shut up and get the sake!
Do you understand?
I'm not bald, okay?
I shaved my head.
Do you under stand?
Sorry.
First time in Japan?
What brings you to Okinawa?
I came to see a man.
Oh, yeah?
You have a friend live in Okinawa?
Not quite.
Not friend?
I never met him.
Never?
Who is he may I ask?
Hattori Hanzo.
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?
I need Japanese steel.
Why do you need Japanese steel?
I have vermin to kill.
You must have big rats you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.
Huge.
May I?
You may.
Wait.
Try the second one down.
Funny...
...you like samurai swords.
I like baseball.
I wanted to show you these.
However someone as you, who knows so much, must surely know...
...I no longer make instruments of death.
What I have here I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...
...I have retired.
Then give me one of these.
These are not for sale.
I didn't say "sell me" I said "give me".
Why should I help you?
Because my vermin is a former student of yours.
And considering the student...
I'd say you have a rather large obligation.
You can sleep here.
lt will take me a month to make the sword.
I suggest you spend it practicing I've completed doing...
...what I swore an oath to God years ago, to never do again.
I have created, "something that kills people".
And in that purpose, I was a success.
I've done this because philosophically, I am sympathetic to your aim.
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.
If on your journey, you should encounter God...
...God will be cut.
Yellow-haired warrior.
Go.
It was one year after the massacre in El Paso, Texas...
...that Bill backed his Nippon progeny financially and philosophically...
...in her Shakespearian-like power struggle with the other yakuza clans...
...over who would rule vice in the city of Tokyo.
When the final sword was sheathed...
...it was O-Ren Ishii and her powerful posse...
...The Crazy that proved the victor.
The pretty lady to O-Ren's right, who's dressed like a villain on Star Trek...
...is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend and second lieutenant...
...the half-French, half-Japanese Sofie Fatale.
Another former protègèe of Bill's.
The young girl in the schoolgirl uniform is O-Ren's personal bodyguard...
...
-year-old Gogo Yubari.
Gogo may be young but what she lacks in age, she makes up for in madness.
Do you like Ferraris?
Ferrari...
Italian trash.
Do you want to screw me?
Don't laugh Do you want to screw me, yes or no?
Yes.
How 'bout now, big boy?
Do you still wish to penetrate me...
...or is it I...
who has penetrated you?
See what I mean?
The bald guy in the black suit and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo...
...the head general of O-Ren's personal army, The Crazy .
And just in case you were wondering...
...how could a half-breed Japanese-Chinese American...
...become the boss of all bosses in Tokyo, Japan?
I'll tell you.
The subject of O-Ren's blood and nationality...
...came up before the council only once.
The night O-Ren assumed power over the crime council.
The man who seems bound and determined to break the mood is Boss Tanaka.
And what Boss Tanaka thinks is...
Boss Tanaka.
What's the meaning of this outburst?
This is a time for celebration.
And what exactly are we celebrating?
The perversion of our illustrious council?
Tanaka, have you gone mad?
I will not tolerate this!
You're disrespecting our sister.
Apologize.
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?
My father along with yours, and along with yours, started this council.
And while...
...you laugh like stupid donkeys they weep in the afterlife...
Shut up!
...over the perversion committed today!
Outrageous!
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council.
Bastard!
Fuck face!
Gentlemen.
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.
By all means, allow him to express it.
I speak, of the perversion done to this council, which I love....
...more than my own children, by making a Chinese Jap-American half breed bitch it's leader!
So that you understand how serious I am...
...I'm going to say this in English.
As your leader...
...I encourage you, from time to time, and always in a respectful manner...
...to question my logic.
If you're unconvinced a particular plan I've decided is the wisest, tell me so.
But allow me to convince you...
...and I promise you right here and now no subject will ever be taboo.
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion.
The price you pay...
...for bringing up either my Chinese or American heritage as a negative is: I collect your fucking head.
Just like this fucker here.
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say...
...now's the fucking time!
I didn't think so.
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.
One ticket to Tokyo, please.
Gogo.
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to any selfish demands they make.
They demand ridiculous things.
Shut up...
Do you know what would happen if they heard you?
What's gonna happen?
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?
You're gonna get your head chopped off.
No, I don't want that.
Yes, it's me.
And if you give us a contact number, we will get back to you.
Hey You!
Who do you remind me of?
Charlie Brown!
You're right, he does look like Charlie Brown.
Charlie Brown, Four pepperoni pizzas.
That's not on our menu...
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!
Hey...
hey...
Charlie, give me a kiss.
O-Ren Ishii!
You and I have unfinished business.
Charlie Brown, beat it.
Miki.
TEAR THE BITCH APART!
So, O-Ren...
...any more subordinates for me to kill?
Hi.
Gogo, right?
Bingo.
And you're Black Mamba.
Our reputations precede us.
Don't they?
Gogo...
...I know you feel you must protect your mistress...
...but I beg you...
...walk away.
You call that begging?
You can beg better than that.
Is that what I think it is?
You didn't think it would be that easy, did you?
You know, for a second there...
...yeah, I kind of did.
"Silly rabbit." "Trix are for kids." This is what you get for fucking around with the yakuzas.
Go home to your mother!
Those of you lucky enough to still have your lives take them with you.
However...
...leave the limbs you've lost.
They belong to me now.
Except you, Sofie!
You stay right where you are.
Your instrument is quite impressive.
Where was it made?
Okinawa.
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.
YOU LIE!
Swords however, never get tired.
I hope you've saved your energy.
If you haven't...
...you might not last five minutes.
But as last looks go, you could do worse.
Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords.
You may not be able to fight like a samurai...
...but you can at least die like a samurai.
Attack me...
...with everything you have.
For ridiculing you earlier...
...I apologize.
Accepted.
Ready?
Come on.
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.
Sofie.
Sofie.
My Sofie.
I'm so sorry.
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.
No more of that.
But still...
But still nothing...
...except my aching heart...
...over what she's done to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie.
I've kept you alive for two reasons.
First reason is information.
Burn in Hell you stupid, stupid blonde.
I'll tell you nothing.
But I am going to ask you questions.
And every time you don't give me answers...
...I'm going to cut something off.
And I promise you...
...they will be things you will miss.
Give me your other arm!
I want all the information on the Deadly Vipers.
If you had to guess...
What they've been doing...
...why she left you alive...
...and where I can find them.
...what would be your guess?
Guessing won't be necessary.
She informed me.
She said I could keep my wicked life for two reasons.
As I said before...
...I've alowed you to keep your wicked life for two reasons.
And the second reason is...
...so you can tell him, in person, everything that happened here tonight.
I want him to witness the extent of my mercy...
...by witnessing your deformed body.
I want you to tell him all the information you just told me.
I want him to know what I know.
I want him to know I want him to know.
And I want them all to know...
...they'll all soon be as dead as O-Ren.
Revenge is never a straight line.
It's a forest.
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...
...to get lost...
to forget where you came in.
That woman...
...deserves her revenge.
And...
...we deserve to die.
She must suffer to her last breath.
How did you find me?
I'm the man.
One more thing Sofie.
I'm doing my part.
I'm doing my part.
I'm doing my part.
I'm doing my part too.
They're doing their part,
are you?

Pay attention.
Sorry, Mr Rasczak.
Let's sum up.
This year we explored
the failure of democracy...
how the social scientists
brought our world...
to the brink of chaos.
We talked about the veterans,
how they took control...
and imposed the stability
that has lasted for generations since.
You know these facts...
but have I taught you anything
of value this year?
Hmm?
You. Why are only citizens
allowed to vote?
It's a reward,
what the Federation gives you
for doing Federal Service.
No. No.
Something given
has no value.
Look, when you vote, you are
exercising political authority.
You're using force. And force,
my friends, is violence,
the supreme authority from which
all other authority is derived.
Uh, my mother always said
violence never solves anything.
Really?
I wonder what the city fathers
of Hiroshima would say about that.
You.
They probably wouldn't say anything.
Hiroshima was destroyed.
Correct.
Naked force has resolved
more issues...
throughout history
than any other factor.
The contrary opinion, that
violence never solves anything,
is wishful thinking
at its worst.
People who forget that
always pay.
Rico, what's the moral
difference, if any...
between a civilian
and a citizen?
A citizen accepts personal
responsibility for the safety...
of the body politic,
defending it with his life.
A civilian does not.
The exact words of the text.
But do you understand it?
Do you believe it?
I don't know.
Of course you don't.
I doubt anyone here would
recognize civic virtue...
if it reached up
and bit you in the ass.
Not here.
Come on, let's see if they
posted the math final.
Rico, we gonna take Tesla?
We're gonna kill 'em.
Remember, all graduating seniors
must fill out a 710 form.
First thing Fleet Academy
looks at is your math scores.
Wish me luck.
Way to go.
Good job.
Your turn.
Hold on.
I want to talk to Marco.
His sister's at Fleet.
What do you hear about Roxy?
She made pilot.
Oh, yeah.
Thirty
five percent.
Very nice.
Look at that. Thirty
five
percent, ladies and gentlemen.
Big numbers.
Sorry.
So, you haven't done it yet,
have you? Don't lie.
I'm not in any hurry.
Others are waiting.
Did you read her mind?
Don't have to.
It's pretty clear
what she wants.
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Aw, you got it bad.
Bye, Marco.
Hey, don't forget about
this afternoon.
He's always late when he walks
you home to fish for a kiss.
Get out of here.
Marco's sister made pilot.
So will you.
I mean, imagine flying a half
a million tons of starship.
You gotta have
nerves of steel.
Yeah, you do. Let's see
how yours hold up.
You may begin.
Aw, come on, it's just a bug.
You better put your goggles on.
"Just a bug."
We humans like to think we are
nature's finest achievement.
I'm afraid
it just isn't true.
This Arkellian sand beetle
is superior in many ways.
It reproduces in vast
numbers, has no ego...
has no fear, doesn't
now about death...
and so is the perfect
selfless member of society.
But humans have created
art, mathematics...
and interstellar travel.
True. But before you
let that go to your head...
take the example
of the Arachnids...
a highly evolved
insect society.
By human standards,
they are relatively stupid...
but their evolution stretches
over millions of years...
Here, take this.
they can
colonize planets...
by hurling their spore
into space.
Okay, I think we got it.
That's the heart.
And here's the stomach.
Nerves of steel, huh?
Don't think about it.
Just go on instinct.
Try to visualize it.
I see the ace of spades.
You know,
statistically speaking,
you should have accidentally
guessed right by now.
So my psychic abilities
are zero and I'm unlucky.
No, luck's not a factor.
No one really knows why some people
are sensitive and some aren't.
Who knows? Maybe it's a new
stage of human evolution.
That's why they do these
kind of Federal studies.
What
Oh, shit. Time out.
Oh, he just wants
some attention.
You don't play
with him any more.
Cyrano.
Go bug Mom, Cyrano.
How do you make him do that?
Oh, I gave him the impression
there's a grub crawling up my mom's leg.
He's on a mission
to go eat it.
Ow! Oh! Get out!
Get off my leg! Oh! Carl!
I sure hope you don't do
anything like that to me.
Don't be afraid.
Can't do human. Yet.
Yeah!
All right!
Touchdown Tigers.
And the score
is now 4 1
38.
Tigers lead
with 2.:46 remaining...
here at the Buenos Aires
Sports Arena.
Time out Giants.
Are you all right?
Yeah!
All right!
Way to go, team!
Hey! Your helmet.
So, what are you doing
after the game?
Well, everyone's going
to the dance, aren't you?
I don't know. It's my
last night as a civilian.
Come on, number 12! Let's go!
Ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
You're going to the Fleet Academy?
huh.
That's where
I want to go!
Come on, number 12!
Let's play ball!
Don't get any ideas
about my girlfriend!
All is fair
in love and war.
Johnny! Yeah!
Hut! Hut!
Hey, yeah!
Giants leading 43
4 1.
Just over 4 2 seconds remaining.
All right, let's go.
Irvin, Lathom,
cover the rush.
Perry, fake left.
Bertolli, you go long.
Rico, flip six three hole.
Got it? Hey, Rico?
What?
You're drifting! Flip six,
three hole, on one! Got it?
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Ready? Break!
Break!
Down. Set.
Tight left.
Hut!
Yeah! Go, go, go!
All right!
Yeah!
He's in there.
It's over.
Who said you could
grow up so fast, huh?
Mom, don't get mushy.
This came for you today.
I presume,
at your request.
A lot of my friends are
doing Federal Service.
Well, you're not
thinking of applying?
Have you lost your mind?
I'd rather take ten lashes in Public
Square than see you ruin your life.
It's a term of service.
It's not a career.
I just want to get
out on my own...
see the galaxy
for a couple years.
Johnny, people get killed
in the Federal Service.
Who gave you this idea?
It's that teacher, isn't it?
What's his name? You know
the one I'm talking about.
Rasczak?
Silly name. There should
be a law against...
using a school
as a recruiting station.
No, Rasczak doesn't do that
at all.
He sort of discourages you.
Well, that's good.
'Cause you're going to Harvard,
and that's the end of it.
It's my decision,
not yours.
Oh, is that how it is, huh?
Wait, you two.
Uh, Dad and I have a surprise
for you that will settle this.
Can you guess what it is?
No.
You wanted to see the galaxy?
How about a trip
to the Outer Rings?
Zegema Beach. Huh?
I've always wanted
to go there.
Good, good.
Then it's all settled.
Sure. Don't go away.
I'm just gonna
go see Mr Rasczak.
Hey, Rico, do you
want to dance?
Actually, Diz,
I promised Carmen
Aw, come on. Too bad for her
if she's not around.
You know, it's sad.
After tonight, most of us...
probably won't
see each other again.
So, you still
gonna play for Rio?
Yeah, looks like.
Unless Tokyo lets me start.
Well, anyone
who gets you is lucky.
Johnny, how come
we never got together?
Can't we just
be friends, Diz?
Sure.
Good night.
Look, Diz, I want to talk
to Mr Rasczak.
Well, you better hurry up
if you want to catch him.
You're the best.
Mr Rasczak!
What is it, Rico?
I want to thank you.
Your class was the best one
I had this year.
Well, it's really not my job to please.
I just hope you learned something.
Well, I want to join up.
I think I got what it takes
to be a citizen.
Good for you.
Go find out.
Well, my parents
are against it.
And I know it's my choice.
I was wondering...
what would you do
if you were me?
Figuring things out
for yourself...
is the only freedom
anyone really has.
Use that freedom.
Make up your own mind, Rico.
But I have not been
to paradise
No, I have not been
to paradise
Watch the days go by
All is fine
Don't exaggerate.
I'm serious. I think you have
really beautiful eyes.
Johnny.
Uh, this is Zander.
Yeah, we know each other
from the game.
No hard feelings?
No, none at all. We won.
Come on, Carmen.
It's the last dance.
Well, maybe I'll see you
at the Academy.
Yeah. Who knows?
Zander's going for pilot too.
You two have
so much in common.
Johnny Rico,
are you jealous?
Well, maybe.
You don't have
to be jealous.
Hey, hey,
break it up, you two.
There's a place
for that sort of thing.
I've been thinking,
and I'm gonna do it, Carmen.
I'm gonna go
for Federal Service.
That's great.
Carl and I are signing up
tomorrow. Come with us.
I will.
My father's
not home tonight.
All is well
All is well
Talk about it
Watch the days go by
All is well
I do now,
of my own free will...
after having been
duly advised and warned...
of the meaning and consequences
of this oath...
enrol in the Federal Service...
for not less than two years...
and as much longer
as may be required...
by the needs
of the Federation.
Thank you.
Fresh meat
for the grinder, eh?
So, how'd you kids do?
I'm gonna be a pilot.
Well, good for you. We need
all the pilots we can get.
Hey, did you get starside R and D?
I don't believe it.
I got Games and Theory.
Games and Theory?
That's military intelligence.
Yeah.
Way to go, Carl.
Next time we meet,
I'll probably have to salute you.
Hmm.
How about you, son?
Good for you.
Mobile Infantry made me
the man I am today.
All recruits must report to the
Federal Transportation Hub...
within 2 4 hours.
Welcome to the adventure
of Federal Service.
Let's make a vow.
No matter what,
we'll always be friends.
I'll go for that.
Well, chances are we'll
never see each other again.
We'll be millions of light
years
away from each other.
But, uh, yeah, sure.
Why not?
You'll resign, and that's
all there is to it.
It may look bad, but if that's
the worst you suffer, then that's fine.
I won't quit!
I'm telling you, you will.
You're not going back.
You're going on vacation!
I am not going
on vacation!
I want to be a citizen.
It's my decision.
I made it.
You walk out that door,
you are cut off, young man.
You understand me?
All right, that's it!
You are cut off!
Johnny, why won't you
change your mind?
Does citizenship
mean that much to you?
Well, yeah, sure.
Well, I hope so.
I hope you don't ruin your life
over some silly little girl...
who wants to look handsome
in a uniform.
Don't talk about Carmen that way!
Johnny.
Your attention, please.
Outbound group 1380,
all hub 29 connections.
Do you have everything?
Moscow now boarding...
at bank 8
Be a good girl, hear?
My dad had to help me pack.
Suddenly he's afraid he's never
gonna see me again or something.
It was sweet,
but it took forever.
Oh. Anyway, I guess
I'm ready to go.
Yeah, me too. I'm wearing
everything I own.
I'm sorry your parents
were mad.
Who cares? The Federation
will give me...
everything I need for
the next two years, right?
You talk to Carl?
Yeah, he left this morning.
Couldn't say where.
Oh, it's exciting, going away.
But I'm scared.
Aren't you?
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you too.
I love you.
Outbound group 94B
to Tereshkova
That's me.
Just say it once.
Try it on for size.
I love you.
Don't forget to write.
I won't.
Fully automatic Morita.
Who wants to hold it?
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!
Citizen rule. People
making a better tomorrow.
A murderer was captured
this morning and tried today.
Guilty.
Sentence.: death.
Execution tonight at 6.:00.
All net. All channels.
If you think you're psychic,
maybe you are.
Federal studies are being
conducted in your community.
Every school kid knows
that Arachnids are dangerous.
However, Mormon extremists
disregarded Federal warnings...
and established Fort Joe Smith deep
inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Too late, they realized that Dantana had
already been chosen by other colonists.:
Arachnids.
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!
Most of you will not...
live to be
in the Mobile Infantry.
The trouble is, you are not
good enough the way you are.
Hands at your side!
Chin up.
I am your senior drill instructor,
Career Sergeant Zim!
Suck in that gut!
Feet together!
To think this had
to happen to me.
What a bunch of apes.
No, strike that!
You don't rate that good.
Never in my life
have I seen
Do you think I'm funny?
Do I make you laugh?
Do you think I'm a comedian, son?
I'm sorry.
The first words and the last words out
of your stinking holes will be "Sir"!
Do you get me?
Sir, yes, sir!
You see that armoury?
Run around it.
Run, I said!
Run, run, run!
Bronski, keep pace!
Move! Move!
Now, anytime you think
I'm being too tough...
anytime you think
I'm being unfair...
anytime you miss
your mommy, quit!
You sign form 1240
A,
you grab your gear...
you take a stroll
down Washout Lane!
Do you get me?
Sir, yes, sir!
Pathetic!
I wonder if there's a handful of
guts in the whole bunch of you.
Now, who here thinks they got
what it takes to knock me down?
Sir! I guess
maybe I do, sir!
Ow! God! God!
You all right, son?
Sir, yes, sir!
It's my arm.
I think it's broken, sir.
God.
Pain is in your mind!
Sir!
Recruit Flores reporting
for duty, sir!
You specifically requested transfer from
Fort Cronkite to this training unit?
Sir, I heard
it was the best, sir!
It is the best.
But what makes you think
you're good enough?
Now that's the kind of gal
who makes squad leader.
That's my job
you're talking about.
Come on.
Here we go!
Here we go!
On the go!
On the go!
One, two, three, four...
one, two, MI!
You know, I'd like
to kill that Sergeant Zim.
Whoa, improper attitude!
They'll kick you out
for talking like that.
bye.
There you go
down Washout Lane.
Yup, you either got what
it takes, or you don't.
Hey, there is a line.
Wait your turn, Ace.
Hey, at ease, little soldier.
It's all the same muck.
Get in line
like everyone else.
You got some guts
for a rich kid.
I guess you and me could be
buddies. What do you say?
Oh
oh, that is
no way to act.
Hey! Of course you are.
Everybody should have
a friend like me.
Come on, Ace. Back of the line
now! Back of the line!
Back, back, back, back!
All right. Hurry up, hurry up.
What a jerk, man.
Tough guy.
Hey, Rico, want
to sit together?
No thanks, Diz.
What's your malfunction, Rico?
You are.
I joined up to get out on my own,
and you had to tag along.
You think I joined the Mobile
Infantry because of you?
You saying you didn't?
Hi.
Forget about it, Ace.
You don't stand a chance.
What makes you even think you're
gonna make squad leader, Rico?
Something I got, you don't.
You rich kids are all the same.
It isn't about that.
It's about who's the best.
Hey!
Third squad!
If someone's hurt, put him on your back
and take him out of there!
Let's go!
Go, Simmons!
Go, go, you sissy!
Sir, I don't understand.
Who needs a knife
in a nuke fight, anyway?
All you gotta do
is push a button, sir.
Cease fire. Put your hand
on that wall, trooper.
Put your hand on that wall!
Damn it.
The enemy cannot push a button
if you disable his hand.
Medic!
Hand me that towel, will you?
Ah, well, we all have
one thing in common.
We were all stupid enough
to sign up for Mobile Infantry.
Breckinridge, what's your excuse?
Oh, my family's all farmers.
I hate farming. I mean,
uh, Mobile Infantry
It's like pure picnic
by comparison.
All right, so they grow 'em big and dumb
on the farm planet, huh?
I like big!
Djana'D, what about you?
Oh, I'm going in for politics...
and, you know, you gotta be
a citizen for that.
So here I am.
Ah, you want some responsibility.
Shujimi, come on, let's keep it goin'.
I got into Harvard,
but my father says forget it.
It's gonna cost an arm
and a leg, you know?
So, if I serve,
Federation pays my way.
I want to have babies.
You know, it's a lot easier to
get a licence if you've served.
I'm going career.
Officer's training. All the way.
Ah!
Future Sky Marshal.
All right, Rico, your turn.
Who asked you to be so nosy?
What? I'm the
the bad guy?
I'm gonna be a writer, you know?
A writer's got
a right to be nosy.
Hey, Flores, you know
Rico from Buenos Aires.
What's his story?
Oh, uh,
he's here
because of a girl.
Oh, Rico! Lover boy!
He's getting me excited.
He's gonna blow.
Is it you?
This is where we live.
It's not much, but it's home.
Right there, that's my bunk,
where I dream about you every night.
Boot's pretty tough.
Sometimes I think I won't make it.
But then I think about what
you're doing, and I try harder.
Hey, guys! Do you mind?
Try harder, baby, try harder!
Who knows? They might even
make me squad leader.
Uh
oh,
I better pack it in.
Oh, I love you, baby,
I love you!
I love you so much
I'm gonna kill you guys!
I love you so much
Bye! Write me.
Bye!
Orbit in five, Ibanez.
First one there
gets to fly.
Locking it down.
Wait! Wait!
Oh, no. Not Ibanez again.
She's crazy!
Ready, go!
Yeah!
Deploying wings.
How come you're
in such a good mood, huh?
'Cause today
I get to fly that.
Pilot Trainee Ibanez
reporting for duty, ma'am.
Take the number two chair,
Ibanez.
You see that?
A, clear.
What are you doing here?
I'm the guy whose gonna
teach you to fly this crate.
Oh, Assistant Instructor.
Should I call you "sir"?
Only when I give you an order.
Prepare for departure.
It's amazing, us running
into each other like this.
Maybe it's fate.
Maybe not.
Heard about this crazy girl
coming through the Academy.
Solid math, a little wild
on the stick, but a natural.
And when it turned out
to be you,
I just made sure that we
would run into each other.
Rodger Young cleared for
undocking and departure.
All right, Ibanez.
Take her out.
Yes, ma'am.
All systems go.
In simulation, my supervisors
could never keep up.
Well, this isn't simulation any more...
so take her out easy, cadet.
Yes, sir.
Five metres from object.
Three metres from object.
Clear.
Don't exceed port speed.
Or what?
Or they revoke your flight
status, and mine.
Your career is
in my hands.
Steady as she goes,
Number Two.
Prepare for warp.
Yes, ma'am.
Number One, design
for Jupiter orbit.
All crew, all sections,
stand by to cut in C
Star drive in five, four,
go!
We're going in!
Move!
Man, they're defended.
No way in.
Flip six, three hole.
What?
You run a flip six, three
hole play, and you can score.
You got it.
Now!
Bastard!
Yeah!
Kid's got some moves.
Give him a squad.
See what he can do.
Kitty, Kitty.
Someone's got to teach you guys
how to play some pool here.
Look at him.
Have you ever seen anybody
so pleased with himself?
Well, Zim must have had to choose
someone to be his brownnose.
All right, where were we?
Okay, watch and learn.
Watch and learn.
I couldn't have done it
without you, Diz.
Friends?
Friends.
Mail call! Levy!
Yeah, that's me.
Yeah, right here.
Yeah, here I am. Ah, great, my dad.
That's all, folks.
Hi, Johnny.
I'm sorry I haven't
written you sooner, but, uh...
it's been really busy.
you don't deserve that!
They've really got us
going here.
They must have made you
squad leader by now.
And if they haven't,
tell 'em to talk to me.
See? All it takes is
the love of a good woman.
That is a woman.
Look at that.
Look at those.
Isn't it beautiful?
I'm dying.
I love it out here.
That's also the problem.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Because I think
I'm gonna go career.
I want to command
a ship of my own.
And you know...
I don't think that's gonna
leave a lot of room...
for you and me, Johnny.
Jeez.
I know that's not
what you wanted to hear.
But, uh...
I have to follow my heart.
I'm sorry.
Write me, all right?
Write me so that I know
we'll always be friends.
Let's get back to the game.
I feel so sorry for Johnny.
Funny how they always
want to be friends...
after they rip your guts
out, huh?
Yeah. Well,
it's what I deserve.
What are you
talking about?
Oh, I joined up for her.
I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for her.
What are you talking about? You
made squad leader on your own.
And, hey, you still got me
to kick around.
Fun and games are over,
children.
You will be firing
live ammunition...
in a simulated combat
environment.
You will exercise extreme
caution on my assault course!
Do you get me?
Sir, yes, sir!
Rico, take 'em out!
First fire team with me.
Next team in ten seconds.
Maximum score has been 2 80.
I expect you to do better!
Go!
Shujimi, stay down!
Hey! Goddam it, Breckinridge,
clear my line of fire!
It's my helmet!
It's all screwed up!
You're gonna
blow the score!
Dumb shit!
Diz, stay put!
What's the problem?
Damn thing keeps getting in my way!
Give it to me.
How come whenever something goes wrong,
it's always you, Breckinridge?
It must be 'cause
I'm big and dumb!
Yeah, right!
Medic!
Rico, you are relieved
of squad command!
Rico, did you give the recruit
permission to remove his helmet?
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge
reported a helmet malfunction...
and I asked him
to show it to me, sir.
Are you rated to repair
the M
3 Tactical Helmet, Rico?
Sir, no, sir!
Then why did you order your man
to remove his helmet...
during a live fire
exercise?
Sir, I needed everyone in
my squad operational, sir!
I wanted to win, sir!
Carry on.
Sergeant, we've already lost
two recruits over this incident.
Do you think there's any possibility
of salvaging this man?
Yes, sir, I do.
All right.
We'll try administrative punishment.
Prisoner, halt!
Bite down on this, son.
It helps.
I know.
For incompetence of command...
for failure to abide
by safety regulations...
during a live fire exercise...
for negligence which contributed
to the death of a teammate...
recruit trainee
John Rico...
is sentenced to
administrative punishment.
Ten lashes.
You may carry out
the sentence.
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five!
Six!
Seven!
Eight!
Nine!
Ten!
All sections secure.
EBS is high normal.
Switching to slave on my mark.
Mark.
Thanks.
You read my mind.
Oh, third watch always
seems to last forever.
I don't know.
It depends on who
you're spending it with.
Something's wrong.
No, I replotted the course.
It's more efficient this way.
Three weeks aboard a starship...
and you think that you
can lick my navs?
Check it.
You know, I was talking
with Captain Deladier...
and, uh, she said
Don't change the subject.
Am I right?
Yeah. Yeah.
You're right.
So, what did
the captain say?
She thinks that we ought
to team up officially...
and crew for her.
You and me, huh?
We're good together, Carmen.
We're way ahead of the curve
in every department.
I can anticipate you.
You know what I want.
No. What do you want?
There's a gravity field
out there.
Run a scan. Sensors on.
Gravity at 225 and rising.
Report.
Captain, we're in the path
of an unidentified object...
moving toward us
at high speed.
Profile suggests
an asteroid, ma'am.
Impact, six seconds!
Emergency evasion!
Three, two,
fire!
Close compartment 21!
Where'd it come from?
It came out of the Arachnid
Quarantine Zone, ma'am.
Number Four, contact Fleet.
Tell 'em there's a loose asteroid
headed their way.
Communications are down,
ma'am. They're gone.
Hull's compromised.
We're lucky
to be alive, ma'am.
Luck didn't have anything
to do with it.
We have a hell
of a flight team.
It really stinks, you going.
Yeah, well, the Mobile Infantry
will just have to get along without me.
I don't get it, Rico.
You took your licks.
If they didn't want you,
they would have kicked you out.
Hey
I joined up for the wrong reasons.
I got a guy killed.
I figure that kind of proves
I don't have what it takes.
Rico, your call's going through.
Take it there.
Hello? Oh, Johnny!
Hi, Mom.
B
Bill, pick it up.
It's Johnny!
Where's your uniform?
Bill.
It's just good
to hear from you.
How are you, son?
It's not really working out
here for me, Dad.
I was thinking
I was hoping it would be
all right if I came home.
Well, of
of course. You should
come home immediately.
I'm sorry.
I've been an idiot.
Don't talk like that.
You just come on home...
talk things out.
We love you, son.
My, what's that?
Looks like rain.
This time of year?
Sure is dark.
Your transmission
has been terminated...
due to atmospheric
interference.
Please try your call
again later.
Sanchez!
Well, see ya.
Hey, you take that stroll
down Washout Lane...
you're only proving
one thing,Johnny.
What's that, Diz?
That you don't have what
it takes to be a citizen.
Mobile Infantry
is passing by
Mobile Infantry
is passing by
Well, sound off
One, two, three, four
That's it! That's it!
Left, right, left.
Do you get me?
Sir, yes, sir!
I can't hear you!
What's going on, you guys?
Move, move, move!
What's happening?
Hey, hey, what's going on?
Wh
What's going on?
Hey, Kitten, what's going on?
It's war! We're going to war!
The devastation we are seeing
is unparalleled.
Judging from early estimates,
millions dead, a city in ruins.
Is that Geneva?
Goddam bugs whacked us,
Johnny.
The meteor was shot out
of orbit by bug plasma...
that derived from Klendathu,
the Arachnids'home planet.
Nothing lives in what was once
called the Latin Paradise.
Oh,Johnny, it's us.
Buenos Aires has been
wiped off the Earth.
That's home.
The Federal Council met moments
ago and voted unanimously...
for mobilization to destroy
the Arachnid threat.
I'm serious. I'll go anywhere.
Forget it, Zim. We need you here.
I want combat, sir.
The only way you're gonna see combat...
is if you bust yourself
to private!
Yes, sir, I get you.
What do you want, Rico?
I wish to reconsider
my request to drop out, sir.
You already signed
your 1240
It wouldn't be legal.
Major, I know it was wrong.
I didn't learn from one mistake,
and I made another, sir.
You made your decision, son.
Sir, my family, my whole family,
was in Buenos Aires, sir.
Is this your signature, Rico?
Sir, yes, it is, sir!
Doesn't look like it to me.
Carry on, Private!
Yes, sir!
Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires
comes first sorrow...
then anger.
The only good bug
is a dead bug.
In Geneva,
the Federal Council convenes.
We must meet the threat
with our valour, our blood...
indeed, with our very lives...
to ensure that human civilization,
not insect...
dominates this galaxy,
now and always!
Sky Marshal Dienes
announces plans...
for an offensive
against Klendathu...
source of the bug meteor
that destroyed Buenos Aires.
Every day, Federal scientists
are looking for new ways to kill bugs.
Your basic Arachnid warrior
isn't too smart...
but you can
blow off a limb...
and it's still 86 percent
combat effective.
Here's a tip.:Aim for the nerve stem,
and put it down for good.
Everyone's doing their part. Are you?
The war effort needs your effort...
at work, at home,
in your community.
We now break net and take you live...
to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga...
deep inside
the Arachnid Quarantine Zone...
where the men and women of the Federal
Armed Services prepare to attack.
D XQ uplink on two, one.
You're on.
No one here in the AQZ
knows exactly...
when the invasion
of Klendathu will occur.
But everyone's
talking about it...
and the talk says tomorrow.
Here's a bunch of MI kids that look
like they could eat bugs for lunch.
Yum, yum, yum.
So, trooper,
you're not too worried
about fighting the Arachnids?
Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole,
you got a lot of dead bugs.
Am I right?
I just hope it's not over
before we get some.
Okay, come on.
Some say the bugs were provoked...
by the intrusion of humans
into their natural habitat...
that a "live and let live policy"
is preferable to war with the bugs.
Let me tell you something.
I'm from Buenos Aires,
and I say kill them all!
Go on, trooper!
Oh, yeah!
Big bad bugs, huh?
Hey, guys,
we ought to get tattoos.
Hey, let's all get cut together.
What do I want a tattoo for?
Oh, what?
Your skin's too pretty?
Come on, everybody's doing it.
Hey,Johnny!
Johnny Rico.
Carmen?
Oh. At ease.
Guess I ought to lose the hat
when I'm off duty.
Carmen.
My mother was right about you.
You look great in a uniform.
You look pretty good yourself.
So, what do you hear?
You know about anyone
who made it out of BA alive?
Most of the time
I don't think about it.
Like it happened
to someone else.
Then it hits me,
and I, uh, can't stop crying.
Well, we're still alive.
Got to be happy about that.
You don't look
very happy to see me.
Should I be?
Johnny, it's different now.
We're at war.
I mean, I think what I did was
probably the best thing for both of us.
Everything copacetic,
Lieutenant?
Zander, you remember Johnny.
Zander and I
are a flight team now.
Yeah, and we're best in the fleet.
I get it.
This is the part that's
best for both of us.
Don't do me any more favours.
Johnny, wait.
No, forget it, Lieutenant.
He's Mobile Infantry.
See, when you're
trained to kill...
it just doesn't pay
to be polite.
You got something to say
about the Mobile Infantry?
I think you heard me.
You want to make
something of it, Private?
Not with an officer.
No, sir.
The MI doesn't mint stupid troopers.
Well, let's disregard rank.
Let it go, Rico.
Let it go.
Everybody hear that?
Rank is not an issue here.
Don't do this.
Come on. What's he gonna do?
Come on, jarheads!
Let go of me! Come on!
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll kill you!
Guys! Guys! Quit it!
Come on! Come on!
He's not worth it!
Come on!
Forget it, Rico! Mobile Infantry
and Fleet don't mix. Come on.
Come on, let's go.
Jarheads.
Mobile Infantry rules!
Yeah!
Oh, God, that hurts.
Hey, well, I got something that might
hurt just a little bit more, buddy.
Oh, yeah! We're gonna fight,
and we're gonna win!
Yeah!
This is the captain speaking.
All personnel
prepare for drop.
We are at D
minus three
and counting.
We are going in
with first wave.
Means more bugs
for us to kill.
You smash the entire area.
You kill anything that has
more than two legs.
You get me?
We get you, sir!
Plasma, ma'am, from the planet.
Bug batteries.
According to military intelligence,
it'll be random and light.
Drop is...
Steady as she goes,
Number Two.
Remember your training,
and you will make it back alive!
This isn't random or light.
Someone made a mistake.
That's it.
We're empty, ma'am.
Someone made
a big goddam mistake!
Break for high orbit!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Johnny!
Rocket crew, move up!
Nuke 'em! Levy! Rico!
Heat 'em up!
Let's go!
First platoon, left flank!
Split up! First and
second squads, follow me.
Two, cover!
One, with me!
Along side! Side to side!
Fire!
Here they come!
Ace, what are we doing?
Uh, I don't know.
I don't know.
Kill them! Kill them all!
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
You want some?
Here's some! Yeah!
Here's some of this!
Oh, my God!
Shujimi!
No, no, no!
Help! Help! Help!
No! God!
Let's get out of here!
Fall back!
Mayday!
What's going on?
fall back to retrieval.
You got com?
fall back to retrieval.
It's a general retreat!
Back to the boats!
Come on!
Come on, let's go!
We've just landed here
on what cap troopers...
are calling Big K...
with the 6th Mobile
Infantry Division.
It's an ugly planet,
a bug planet.
A planet hostile
to life as we
Help me!
Squad right!
Come on! Go, go, go!
Get out of here now!
Watch your step!
Watch your flank! Watch your flank!
GXR, we're being overrun.
Kitten, no!
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh! Oh!
Crisis for humankind.
Fleet officials admit
they underestimated...
the Arachnids'
defensive capability.
Accepting responsibility
for Klendathu...
Sky Marshal Dienes resigns.
His successor,
Sky Marshal Tahat Meru...
outlines her new strategy.
To fight the bug...
we must understand the bug.
We can ill afford
another Klendathu.
Federal scientists
struggle to explain...
the intelligent military actions
of the Arachnids.
When a colony reaches
a certain size...
it gets smarter.
Insects with intelligence?
Have you ever met one?
I can't believe...
I am hearing this nonsense.
Would you just wait a moment?
This is the most ridiculous
conversation I have ever had.
Maybe...
there is some kind of bug
that we haven't seen yet.:
a leadership caste,
a
a hive brain.
Brain Bugs? Frankly, I find the idea
of a bug that thinks offensive!
Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young
requesting approach vector.
Affirmative, Rodger Young.
One
two.
Welcome back.
My God.
How could this happen?
We thought we were smarter
than the bugs.
Give me something, please!
It hurts!
Be right with you.
Help me.
It's strange. There's
almost no wounded at all.
Bugs don't take prisoners.
Oh, no.
Look.
See it? Right there.
There he is.
Come on, we'll just wake him up.
Hey,Johnny! Hey!
How you doin', fish boy?
Hey, look.
You're dead!
Killed in action!
Three more days.
And you're out.
Good as new. See you later.
Bye.
So what do you hear
about our new unit?
Roughnecks killed more bugs
than any other outfit on Big K.
Yeah, well, I hear their
lieutenant's a real nutbuster.
Who's top kick?
You want the job, huh?
I wouldn't mind.
I would.
Just doing my part.
Orders.
Yours?
Where you been
besides Big K?
Outer rings, Zegema Beach.
I always wanted to go there.
It's not there any more.
So, I hear your lieutenant's
a real nutbuster.
No one talks about
the lieutenant that way.
He saved my life.
Same for me.
Me too.
Well, sounds like
he's quite a guy.
Who do you think
saved your ass?
Stand by.
Attention on deck!
This is for you new people.
I only have one rule:
Everyone fights.
No one quits.
You don't do your job,
I'll shoot you.
Do you get me?
We get you, sir!
Welcome to the Roughnecks.
Rasczak's Roughnecks!
At ease. Listen up.
We got a new Sky Marshal
and a new battle plan.
We're gonna clean out the
systems outlying Klendathu...
one planet at a time.
Tomorrow
we hit Tango Urilla.
After Fleet glasses
the planet, MI mops up.
Carry on.
All right.
Spread out!
Fire teams! You locate
a bug hole, nuke it.
Watkins, shake out
Flores and Rico.
Copy that.
Move out!
First platoon,
we're going for that ridge.
Levy, you're with me.
No, I'm in A Squad.
I'm going with Rico.
Shut up and follow me!
Hey, you like that?
Fungus
sucking sack
of maggot puke!
It's dead, Watkins!
It's dead!
Ain't much to look at after
you scrape them off your boot.
Bug hole. There.
Nuke 'em, Rico!
Fire in the hole!
Watkins, we're under
heavy attack. Position M
Get over here!
You got a bug problem, ma'am?
Ah, stow it, trooper!
Tanker!
Come on! Move!
Get down!
Come on!
Stay down, sucker!
Well done!
Call for retrieval.
Nice moves.
Where'd you learn how
to do that, soldier?
Back in school, sir.
Don't you remember?
I was captain of the team.
I need a corporal.
You're it until you're dead
or till I find somebody better.
Thank you, sir.
All right, saddle up! Show's over.
Way to go, Corporal.
Hey, I need a squad leader.
Oh, no. No, I've been there
and blew it.
I'm just here to fight.
What about it, Diz?
First sergeant,
get your gear in section
Looks like
I'm your girl, sir.
Catch you later.
All right.
Listen up!
I expect the best,
and I give the best!
Here's the beer!
Here's the entertainment!
Have fun!
That's an order!
This one's for me!
Thank you, Lieutenant!
Rico!
You kill bugs good.
Thanks.
You knew the lieutenant
before the war.
What was he like?
He was a teacher.
Kind of like he knew it all.
He always had
this little smile.
Yeah, well, he don't
smile much any more.
Yeah, well, I guess your bottle fills up
real quick when your kids get smeared.
Come on, Corporal.
Ah, nah, I don't do that any more.
I remember when you used to dance.
Come on.
Do I have to pull rank?
Excuse me, sir.
Rico. You once asked me
for advice. Want some now?
Lieutenant, HQ is on the com.
Never pass up a good thing.
Watkins. Beer?
Ace.
So, Rico, what are you
doing after the dance?
What's so funny?
You know, just the way
things work out.
We finally
got together, Diz.
I love you,Johnny.
Rico!
We're moving out.
There's been a distress call
from General Owen on Planet P.
So get your shit wired
and report in ten minutes.
Yes, sir.
Who's that with you?
Flores, sir.
Make it 20 minutes.
Yes, sir.
Twenty minutes?
We can do it.
Whiskey Outpost,
do you copy?
This is Roughneck 2
0
on tac three. Come in, please.
Whiskey Outpost,
Whiskey Outpost,
this is Roughneck 2
0
on tac three.
Any contact with General Owen?
No, sir.
Not even
the transponder signal.
It's these canyons.
Go to higher ground, Sergeant.
Whiskey Outpost,
Whiskey Outpost...
this is Roughneck 2
Look out!
Sugar, your weapon.
Help me! Help me!
I'd expect anyone in this unit
to do the same for me.
Sir.
You're acting sergeant.
Move 'em out.
You heard the lieutenant!
Saddle up!
Jeez, someone really
humped the bunk.
Sir.
Secure this compound.
Police these bodies.
Yes, sir. Give me three
up on the tower, now!
OP there! OP there!
Number Two, police up these bodies!
Stinks in there.
Second squad,
come with me on the gate!
Churchill, come with me!
Yes, sir.
We need retrieval.
This place crawls.
Get somebody in the communications tent
and get me an uplink.
Yes, sir.
Diz, check it out.
Command group with me.
Ah, shit.
Lieutenant!
Dirty bugs came in right
while they were having chow.
Yeah, this is
where they got in.
Lieutenant.
I think you're gonna
want to see this.
What do you got, Flores?
God, I hate this place.
What does that look like
to you, Rico?
Looks like a bug was
in his brain, sir.
They sucked his brains out.
Open that.
Officer on the deck!
Pick up the general.
Gone?
Is it safe? We've got
to get out of here!
Sir!
Thank God for you,
all of you.
You're all gonna be heroes.
Every last one of you.
Close that hole.
Yes, sir.
I had to evade capture. The security
of the Federation was at stake.
Fire in the hole!
I have operational knowledge
of what we're up to out here.
Flores, I need that uplink.
Working on it, sir.
They get in your mind.
Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2
Look, they did it to Farley.
Do you read?
They got in his mind.
Come in, Battlegroup.
This is Roughneck 2
0.
They make you do things.
They made Farley call headquarters.
The distress call was a trap.
They're just like us.
They want to know what makes us tick.
They want to know us,
so they can kill us.
Roughnecks, this is lead.
Prepare for attack.
I repeat, we're gonna be attacked.
Where's the retrieval boat?
Mayday. Mayday. This is Roughneck 2
0
to Battlegroup. Do you read?
Come in, Battlegroup.
This is Roughneck 2
0.
We're gonna die!
Don't you understand?
We're all gonna die!
Second squad, follow me!
Control yourself, General.
I can't.
I can't.
I wish you'd just shoot me.
Lieutenant! He's just a little
out of his mind, sir.
Bugs! Bugs!
All right.
Warm it all up!
Everything you've got!
Come on, you apes!
You want to live forever?
I got bugs!
Fire at will!
Incoming!
Down!
No! Hey!
Watch your fire!
Watch casualties!
Rico, where's
my communication?
Diz, status on the uplink!
Give me a minute.
We don't have a minute!
Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2
0.
We are under
This is Rodger Young. Go ahead.
We are under attack, sir.
We need retrieval now!
We have Planet Pas clear.
This place crawls, sir.
We need pickup now!
What's your position?
Come down on this transmission.
Inside the outpost?
That's crazy!
Well, I hope you have
a crazy pilot. Out!
Lieutenant!
Boat coming down, sir!
Fall back into the compound!
Fall back!
Hold here!
Hold what you've got!
Running low!
I'm out!
Here! Make 'em count!
Make cover fire!
Fall back!
Move, move, move!
Fall back to the boat!
Haul ass!
Oh, my God!
Get him outta there!
Come on!
Rico! Rico!
You know what to do!
Yes, sir!
Do it, Rico!
Dizzy!
No!
Ace, help me!
Hold her down!
Move!
Get her into the boat!
Come on, Diz!
Don't die on me!
Let's get her out!
Let's go, let's go!
Let's go! Get aboard!
Tower, let's go!
Let's move it, tower!
Run!
Lift off!
Johnny, I'm dying
No.
You're gonna be
all right, Diz.
It's all right...
because I got to have you.
Johnny, don't let me go!
Joh
This is traffic control. Proceed
on vector five
seven.
I think you should know...
your friend Rico
is back there.
Get on the com and tell Fleet
to glass that rock.
On whose authority,
Corporal?
That would be mine, sir.
I assumed command of the mission.
Rodger Young,
we have an official request...
by the Mobile Infantry
to commence bombardment of Planet P.
I thought you were dead.
I'm not, but a lot
of my troopers are.
Negative on your request,
DeRuyter.
The Sky Marshal has
other plans for Planet P.
Welcome back.
MI does the dying.
Fleet just does the flying.
Hold on.
Something's up.
Fleet's mobilized
for a big operation.
Attention on deck!
Once somebody asked me...
if I knew the difference
between a citizen...
and a civilian.
I can tell you now.
A citizen has the courage...
to make the safety of the human race
their personal responsibility.
Dizzy was my friend.
She was a soldier.
But more than that...
she was a citizen
of the Federation.
Present arms!
Order arms!
Left face!
Officer on deck!
Carry on.
Burial detail dismissed.
At ease.
How are you, Carl?
Carmen, good.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had
to be your unit on P.
That mission had a very low
survival probability.
The bugs laid a trap
for us, didn't they?
Elegant proof
of intelligence, isn't it?
We thought there might be
a Brain Bug on P.
You knew, and you
sent them anyway?
We couldn't afford to launch an
operation if there wasn't one.
You don't approve.
Well, too bad.
We're in this for the species,
boys and girls.
It's simple numbers.
They have more.
And every day I have
to make decisions...
that send hundreds of people
like you to their deaths.
Didn't they tell you,
Colonel?
That's what the Mobile
Infantry is good for.
I hope you're ready for more.
We're going back to P
to capture that Brain.
The Roughnecks
are always ready, sir.
I hear they need a new lieutenant.
Want the job?
I'll take it, till I get killed
or you find someone better.
Attention. All personnel
report to your stations.
Prepare for drop in 7 5 minutes.
Take care of yourself,Johnny.
I'll see you again.
Officer on deck!
Who are all these kids?
We got reinforced.
Most of them are
fresh out of boot.
We're the old men, Ace.
This is for all you new people.
I only have one rule:
Everyone fights.
No one quits.
If you don't do your job,
I'll kill you myself.
Do you get me?
We get you, sir!
Welcome to the Roughnecks.
Rico's Roughnecks!
Today we're gonna pay
a visit to Bug City.
We're lookin' for a bug
no one's ever seen before.
Some kind of smart bug.
And it probably knows
we're comin'.
Saddle up now!
Come on!
Run, run, run, run, run!
Evasive action.
Get us clear for warp,
Number Two.
Clear in five, four...
Initiating star drive...
in five.
This is Rodger Young. We're going down
Repeat, this is Rodger Young.
We're going down.
Abandon ship! Come on!
Carmen! Oh!
We've got to get to the rescue deck!
Come on!
Captain!
Abandon ship.
That's an
She's dead, Carmen.
She's dead!
Go! Here!
Follow me!
Ready?
Hit it!
Life pod Bravo 6

two aboard.
Scanning for a landing zone!
Checking terrain. Here!
Can you handle that?
Piece of cake.
We've lost the Rodger Young!
What is your position?
Flight Command, we have confirmation.
The Rodger Young is down.
This is Flight Command.
Please repeat.
Please repeat.
We now have confirmation.
Rodger Young is down.
I repeat, Rodger Young is down.
Rodger Young just burned up.
It's on the rescue net.
Life pod Bravo 6

Is anyone receiving?
Is anyone receiving?
Well, they're getting tarred
up there pretty bad.
Life pod...
Bravo 6
3, two aboard.
Is anyone receiving?
Is anyone receiving?
Affirmative.
This is Roughneck 2
0.
You're breaking up.
Say again.
Say again. I'm losing you.
Carmen!
Prepare for landing.
Retros in three...
two, one, fire!
Carmen. Carmen.
Hey, are you okay?
huh.
Get out.
Get out.
This is Roughneck 2
0. Are you
receiving? Over. This is Roughneck 2
Carmen, are you receiving?
Johnny, is that you?
It's me! Wh
What's your
position and situation?
Yeah.
We're in Bug City,
Position:
south 42, east 118.
Situation is
I repeat.
South 4 2, east 118.
What's your situation?
Over.
Carmen.
Situation is
extremely hostile.
I need a squad
to pull 'em out!
Three clicks, south by southwest.
Look out!
What do you wanna do?
You heard the lieutenant.
Rescue party!
Third squad, come with me!
Cancel that!
You know as well as I do,
she's already dead.
Sorry, buddy.
Roughnecks, let's move.
All right.
Why didn't they kill us?
They want us alive.
We should go this way.
A Company's that way.
Yeah, but Carmen's
down there.
Hey, I hate to be rude, buddy,
but word has it she's dead.
She's still alive.
How do you know?
I don't know how I know, but I know.
Listen.
You got command,
but going off mission
That's a serious offence.
Yeah.
I think they
hang you for that.
Roughneck 2
0,
proceed on mission.
I need two volunteers.
One day...
someone like me...
is gonna kill you...
and your whole fucking race.
You know what this is?
Sure you do.
You're some kind
of big, fat, smart bug...
aren't you?
Come on.
This is Roughneck 2
0.
Brain Bug sighted moving
west of grid five.
Run!
Go! Go!
Give me the nuke!
You trying to be a hero, Watkins?
I'm trying to kill
some bugs, sir!
Get outta here!
Get outta here!
Move!
Come on! You like that?
You like that? Come on!
You want a little more?
You like that? You like that?
You like that? You like that?
You want a little more?
Come on! Come on!
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, Carmen.
We did it!
What's going on?
They got it!
Come on!
Pull! Pull! Pull!
Quiet!
What's it thinking, Colonel?
It's afraid.
It's afraid!
Yeah!
Carl! Carl! Hey!
Well, look who's here.
You made it. Good.
It was you, wasn't it?
You told me how to find Carmen.
Well, that's classified.
You know, whenever
the three of us are together...
I feel like things
might just work out.
I hope you're right,
Carmen.
We've got one of their Brains now.
Pretty soon we'll know how they think.
And then we'll know
how to beat them.
One day it will all be over...
and everyone will forget
that this was the moment.
This is when it turned.
And it wasn't the mighty Fleet,
it wasn't some fancy new weapon.
It was a drill instructor named Zim
who captured a Brain.
Come on!
Who am I?
Zim?
He got him! Yeah!
Zim. Zim got the bug.
Zim got the bug, man!
Good job, Sergeant.
Thank you, sir.
That would be private, sir.
Carry on, Private.
Yeah!
What mysteries
will the Brain Bug reveal?
Federal scientists are working
around the clock to probe its secrets.
Once we understand the bug,
we will defeat it.
We have the ships.
We have the weapons.
We need soldiers.
Soldiers like

We're over the target

And Captain Carmen Ibanez.
This is the captain speaking.
All personnel
prepare for drop.
Soldiers like Private Ace Levy

You wanna live forever?
We need you all.

I'm alone.
Aren't we all?
You're late, .
I had to stop in the bathroom.
Ready to save the world again?
After you, .

For England.
For England, Alec.
It's too easy.
Half of everything is luck, James.
And the other half?
Fate.
Set timers: six minutes.
Six minutes.
Check.
Fire.
Closing time, James.
Last call.
Buy me a pint.
This is Colonel Ourumov.
Come out with your hands up.
How original.
Shut the door, Alec.
There's a draught.
Alec?
Move out.
Throw down your weapon and walk towards me, slowly.
Finish the job, James.
Blow them to hell.
You have ten seconds.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...
For England, James.
Hold your fire.
You'll blow the gas tanks.
This is your last chance.
Come out with your hands...
Wait.
You can't win.
Get out there.
Move.
Move it.
Hold your fire.
Wait.

More often than you'd think.
I enjoy a spirited ride as much as the next girl, but...
Who's that?
The next girl.
James, stop this.
Stop it.
I know what you're doing.
What's that, dear?
You are just trying to show off the size of your...
Engine?
Ego.
We're having a pleasant drive and you bring psychology into it.
I was just sent here to evaluate you.
Let's put that behind us, shall we?
Ladies first.
James, I want you to stop this car.
Really?
Stop this car at once.
As you can see, I have no problem with female authority.
James, you're incorrigible.
What am I going to do with you?
Let's toast your evaluation, shall we?
A very thorough evaluation.
Bonsoir, Monsieur Bond.
Très heureux de vous revoir.
Bonsoir, Pierre.
Ça va bien?
Très bien.
Et vous?
Sept à la banque.
Madame wins.
Bet, mademoiselle?
Non?
Monsieur.
Bets, ladies and gentlemen?
No players?

It appears we share the same passions.
Three, anyway.
I count two motoring and baccarat.

I hope the third is where your real talent lies.

And what words do you live by?
The trick is to quit while you're ahead.
That's one trick I've never learned.
Perhaps you'll show me how it's done.
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.
And for you?
The same.
How do you take it?
Straight up, with a twist.
Thank you, Mr..
The name's Bond.
James Bond.
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.
Onatopp?
Onatopp.
Your accent...
Georgian?
Very good, Mr Bond.
You've been to Russia.
Not recently.
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.
It's very different now.
A land of opportunity.
With a new Ferrari in every garage?
No, not quite.
That belongs to a friend.
A tip for your friend: the French number plates for this year's model start with "L".
Even the counterfeit ones.
And what rank do you hold with the motor vehicles department, Mr Bond?
Commander.
Shall we go?
This one is an admiral.
I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank.
Nice to meet you, Mr Bond.
The pleasure, I'm sure, was all mine.

I trust you'll stay "onatopp" ofthings.

Yes!
Yes!

My respects, Admiral.
Delighted to have you aboard, mademoiselle.

What you are about to see is Europe's answer to the electronic battlefield: the first working prototype of the Tiger helicopter.
Uniquely manoeuvrable, the Tiger not only uses Stealth technology, it is hardened against all forms of electronic interference, radio jamming and electromagnetic radiation.
I have a small surprise from your friends at the barracks.
I think I've gone to heaven.
Not yet.
Please welcome the pilots.

Boris.
What?
I thought I'd post it on the lnternet, no?
What's the password?
I made it easy this time.
Even you should be able to break it, borscht-for-brains.
All right.
All right.
I'll give you a hint.
They're right in front of you and can open very large doors.
You're such a geek.
Yes.
I'm in.
You've hacked into the US Department of Justice.
What if they trace it here?
The chief of computers will call me a genius, move me to Moscow and give me a million bucks hard currency.
I think not.
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They'll never detect me.
You were saying, slug-head?
Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko.
Spiked them.
Come on, Boris.
Just hang up.
No way.
I spiked them.
All right.
What's the password?
I'm not going to tell you.
OK.
Let me guess.
It's not in front of me?
You sit on it, but you can't take it with you.
My program seizes the phone line of whoever's tracing me and jams their modem so they can't hang up.
Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
"Better luck next time, slug-heads." Bang.
Gone.
I am invincible.
Was it good for you, too?
I'm getting some coffee.
I'm going for a cigarette.
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov, head of Space Division.
General, if I'd known...
You'd have been ready.
This is an unscheduled test of Severnaya, Major.
War simulation.
We are going to test-fire GoldenEye.
Report your status.
Two operational satellites, sir, Petya and Mischa, in -minute earth orbit at km.
Good.
Here is the authorisation code.
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access numbers for satellite Petya, please.
I am timing you.
Good.
Thank you, Major.
On my count.
Three, two, one...
Set target.
Severnaya.
Arm the weapon.
Check it.
Their best response time is minutes.
They'll be late.
It's clean.
I had to ventilate someone.
Good evening, Moneypenny.
Good evening, James.
M will meet you in the Situation Room.
I'm to take you in.
Never seen you after hours.
Lovely.
Thank you, James.
Out on some kind of assignment?
Dressing to kill?
I know you'll find this crushing, but I don't sit at home praying for an international incident so I can run down here all dressed up to impress James Bond.
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theatre.
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.
What would I ever do without you?
As far as I can remember, James, you've never had me.
Hope springs eternal.
This sort of behaviour could qualify as sexual harassment.
Really?
What's the penalty for that?
Someday you have to make good on your innuendoes.
After you, Moneypenny.
No, I insist.
You first.
Good evening, .
Tanner.
What's up?
minutes ago, we intercepted a distress call from a supposedly abandoned radar station at Severnaya.
Look.
We found a match.
Your missing Tiger.
In the middle of northern Russia?
Your hunch was right.
Too bad the evil queen of numbers wouldn't let you play it.
You were saying?
No, no.
I was just...
just...
Good.
Because if I want sarcasm, I'll talk to my children, thank you very much.
Good evening, .
Good evening, M.
The prime minister's waiting for an update.
Proceed with your briefing, Mr Tanner.
Thank you.
Yes, after the distress signal, your helicopter took off and the Russians had three MiGs intercept it.
What do you think the base is used for?
We suspected it might be the ground station for a secret space-based weapon called GoldenEye, but...
Our statistical analysis saw they had neither the finance nor technology.
Numbers were never my strong suit.
Are these pictures live?
Unlike the American government, we prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.
Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.
What the bloody hell was that?
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
Boris.
Boris.
Thanks.
Our satellite is knocked out.
So are two of the Americans'.
We have another, coming into range now.
Good God.
Two of the MiGs are down.
It looks like the third went into the dish.
What do you think?
No lights.
Not one single electric light on in a -mile radius.
EMP?
It would explain the MiGs and satellites.
And the blackout.
Electromagnetic pulse.
A satellite weapon developed by the...
Americans and Soviets in the Cold War.
I've read the brief.
Discovered after Hiroshima.
Set off a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.
Creates a pulse, a radiation surge, that destroys everything electronic.
The idea being to knock out the enemy's communications before they can retaliate.
So, GoldenEye exists.
Yes.
Could this be an accident?
No.
The helicopter.
For stealing the GoldenEye, it was the perfect getaway vehicle.
Setting off the blast would wipe out any trace of the crime.
The Janus group?
It may be linked to the helicopter.
I know the Russian fail-safe systems.
You just don't walk in and ask for the keys to the bomb.
You need the access codes.
There had to be an insider.
At least one person probably knows who it is.
Very well, sir.
Thank you.
Good night.
The prime minister's talked to Moscow.
It was "an accident on a training exercise".
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.
What else do we know about Janus?
Top-flight arms dealers, headquartered in St Petersburg.
Restocked the lraqis during the Gulf War.
The head man's unreliably described.
No photographs.
The woman, Onatopp, is our only confirmed contact.
Would you care for a drink?
Thank you.
Your predecessor kept some cognac...
I prefer bourbon.
Ice?
Yes.
We pulled the files on whoever may have had access or authority at Severnaya.
The top name on the list's an old friend of yours, I understand.
Ourumov.
They made him a general.
He sees himself as the next "iron man of Russia".
Our political analysts say he doesn't fit the profile of a traitor.
Are these the same analysts who said that GoldenEye couldn't exist?
Who said the helicopter posed no threat and wasn't worth following?
You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.
You think I'm an accountant, more interested in numbers than your instincts.
The thought had occurred to me.
Good.
Because I think you're a sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War, whose boyish charms, though wasted on me, obviously appealed to that young woman I sent out to evaluate you.
Point taken.
Not quite, .
If you think I don't have the balls to send a man out to die, your instincts are dead wrong.
I've no compunction about sending you to your death.
But I won't do it on a whim, even with your cavalier attitude towards life.
I want you to find GoldenEye.
Find who took it, what they plan to do with it, and stop it.
If you come across Ourumov, guilty or not, don't run off on a vendetta.
Avenging Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.
You didn't get him killed.
Neither did you.
Don't make it personal.
Never.
Bond...
Come back alive.
St Petersburg, Russia Good morning, General Ourumov.
Defence Minister Mishkin...
Gentlemen.
Please, deliver your report.
As you know, hours ago, a secret weapons system codename GoldenEye - was detonated over Severnaya.
As head of Space Division, I personally undertook the investigation.
I have concluded this crime was committed by Siberian separatists seeking to create political unrest.
Regrettably, the peaceful work and the hard-currency earnings of Severnaya have been set back by several years.
Therefore, I tender my resignation.
It seems the council does not want your head, Arkady Grigorovich.
Merely your assurance that there are no other GoldenEyes.
I can give you that assurance, Defence Minister.
And what of the two missing Severnaya technicians?
I was aware only of the one.
Boris Grishenko.
There was a girl also, whose body was not among the dead.
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
A level-two programmer.
I will investigate immediately.
It would seem presumptuous to blame this incident on Siberian separatists before the whereabouts of your own people are determined.
Do you agree?
Yes, Defence Minister.
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
That will be all.
Morning, Q.
Sorry about the leg.
Skiing?
Hunting.
Right.
Now pay attention, .
First, your new car.
BMW.
Agile, five forward gears, all-points radar.
Self-destruct system.
And, naturally, all the usual refinements.
Now, this I'm particularly proud of.
Behind the headlights, Stinger missiles.
Excellent.
Just the thing for unwinding after a rough day.
Need I remind you, that you have a licence to kill, not break the traffic laws.
I wouldn't think of it.
Good.
Right.
Let's get on to more practical matters.
A typical leather belt.
Male, size buckle, notch.
Have you finished?
Yes.
Good.
A typical belt...
Q, I'm familiar with that device.
Not one with a -foot rappelling cord built into the buckle.
Fire, and out shoots a piton, followed by a high-tensile wire designed to support your weight.
I see.
And what if I need additional support?
It's tested for one, .

A pen.
This is a class grenade.
Three clicks arms the four-second fuse.
Another three disarms it.
How long did you say the fuse was?
Grow up, .
"The pen is mightier than the sword." Thanks to me, it is.
Look, let's ask Freddie here to demonstrate for us.
Here we are.
Sorry about this, Fred.
One, two, three.
Don't say it.
The writing's on the wall?
Along with the rest of him.
Now, do please try and return...
Do try and return some of this equipment in pristine order.
Don't touch that.
That's my lunch.
In London, April's a spring month.
Oh, yeah?
What are you - the weatherman?
For cryin'out loud.
Another stiff-assed Brit, with your secret codes and passwords.
One of these days you guys are gonna learn just to drop it.
Come on.
My car's over there.
After you.
Thank you.
Like you said, drop it.
All right.
In London, April's a spring month.
In St Petersburg, we freeze our butts off.
Close enough for government work?
No.
Show me the rose.
Please, no.
All right, all right, all right.
"Muffy"?
Third wife.
Jack Wade, CIA.
James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.
That's a nice move.
Nice car.
Hasn't let me down yet.
She's an ugly little bitch, but she gets you there.
Hey, Bond.
Do you do any gardening?
St Petersburg express has now arrived at Platform .
Can you hand me that wrench, Jimmy?
So what do you know about Janus?
Zilch.
Zipsky.
No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.
KGB, military.
Screwdriver.
Rumour has it he lives on one of those old Soviet missile trains.
That armoured stuff they used to run around so we couldn't target 'em.
Wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo?
No, the bigger one.
The sledge.
Anyways, to tell the truth, you don't find this guy.
He finds you.
Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.
Best thing I can do is point you in the direction of his competition.
Who is the competition?
An ex-KGB guy.
Tough mother.
Limps on his right leg.
Name's Zukovsky.
Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
Yeah.
You know him?
I gave him the limp.
Yes?
Are these all you have?
How many do you want?
for the American school, for the Swedish.
IBM-compatible with meg hard drives, CD-ROM and .
modems.
You pay dollars?
Of course.
If madam requires a demonstration...
Madam requires one demonstration model and a quiet place to test it.
Natalya.
Is everything satisfactory?
Everything except the interruption.
Let me get this straight, Jimmy.
You shot him in the leg, you stole his car, you took his girl.
And now you want Zukovsky to set you up with Janus?
Yes.
Are you gonna appeal to his heart?
No.
His wallet.
That might work.
OK.
Showtime.
Valentin operates out of building number .
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Last guy who dropped in uninvited went home air freight in very small boxes.
Make sure they send me home first class.
Natalya.
It's me.
It's Boris.
It's Boris.
It's Boris.
Hello.
Another morning shot to hell.
Free-market economy!
I swear it will be the end of me.
Walther PPK, .
mm.
Only three men I know use such a gun.
I believe I've killed two of them.
Lucky me.
I think not.
Ooh-ahh And if you love him Love him Oh, be so proud of him Of him Cos after all He's just a man Stand by your man...
James Bond.
Charming, sophisticated secret agent.
"Shaken, but not stirred." I see you haven't lost your delicate sense of humour, Valentin.
Or your need for an audience.
Who's strangling the cat?
Strangling a cat?
Stand by your man That is lrina, my mistress.
Very talented girl.
Irina.
Take a hike.
So, Mr Bond, what is it that brings you to my neighbourhood?
Still working for Ml or have you joined the st century?
I hear the new M is a lady.
I want you to do me a favour.
He wants me to do him a favour.
My knee aches every single day.
Twice as bad when it is cold.
Have you any idea how long the winter lasts in this country?
Tell him, Dimitri.
It depends...
Silence.
For an ex-KGB agent, you surprise me, Valentin.
Surely you must have realised the skill was not to hit your knee, but to miss the rest of you.
So why did you not kill me?
Call it professional courtesy.
Then I should extend you the same courtesy.
Kirov's funeral parlour, four o'clock this afternoon.
pounds of C explosives hidden in a casket.
Your man drives the hearse in, the money's exchanged, their man drives the hearse out.
Their man will be arrested with the explosives.
Your man will make a miraculous escape with the money.
Your money.
And what do I owe for this accommodation?
I want you to set me up with Janus.
What has he done to deserve you?
Stole a helicopter.
I have six.
Three.
None that fly.
Who's counting?
These aren't just criminals but traitors.
They used the chopper to steal a nuclear weapon.
Killed a lot of innocent Russians.
What do you expect from a Cossack?
Who?
This Janus I never met the man, but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.
The group that worked for the Nazis, Second World War.
You know your history.
At the end of the war, the Lienz Cossacks surrendered to the British in Austria, believing they would join them and wage war against the communists.
But the British betrayed them, sent them back to Stalin, who promptly had them all shot.
Women, children, families.
Not exactly our finest hour.
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.
You meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel.
And then you and I are even and he owes me one.
Precisely.
You don't need the gun, Commander.
That depends on your definition of safe sex.
That's close enough.
Not for what I have in mind.
You think you can hurt me?
You think you can break me?
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
No, no, no.
No more foreplay.
Take me to Janus.
Buliatch.
Take me to Janus.
Buliatch.
This is it?
Yes.
Well, I must say, I've had a lovely evening.
You?
Once again, the pleasure was all yours.
You'll understand if I don't call.
I won't lose sleep over it.
Sweet dreams.
Hello, James.
Alec?
Back from the dead.
No longer just an anonymous star on the Memorial Wall at Ml .
What's the matter, James?
No glib remark?
No pithy comeback?
Why?
Hilarious question.
Particularly from you.
Did you ever ask why we toppled all those dictators and regimes, only to come home "Well done.
Good job, but sorry, old boy." "Everything you risked your life for has changed." It was the job we were chosen for.
Of course you'd say that.
James Bond, Her Majesty's loyal terrier, defender of the so-called faith.
Please, James, put it away.
It's insulting to think I haven't anticipated your every move.
Yes.
I trusted you, Alec.
Trust.
What a quaint idea.
How did the Ml screening miss that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?
Once again, your faith is misplaced.
They knew.
We're both orphans, James.
But where your parents had the luxury of dying in a climbing accident, mine survived the British betrayal and Stalin's execution squads.
But my father couldn't let himself or my mother live with the shame of it.
Ml figured I was too young to remember.
And in one of life's little ironies, the son went to work for the government whose betrayal caused the father to kill himself and his wife.
Hence Janus, the two-faced Roman god, come to life.
It wasn't God who gave me this face.
It was you, setting the timers for three minutes instead of six.
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
No.
You're supposed to die for me.
By the way, I did think of asking you to join my little scheme, but somehow I knew 's loyalty was always to the mission, never to his friend.
Closing time, James.
Last call.
For England, James.
Wake up.
Mister.
Wake up, please.
Wake up.
I'm here.
I'm here.
Hurry.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Pull yourself together or we're gonna die.
Do something.
Get us out of here.
I'm a little tied up.
Never mind.
The things we do for frequent-flier mileage.
Here.
Let me help you.
That's it.
Mind your head.
Let me go.
Who are you?
Listen.
I'm on your side.
I don't know anything.
I don't believe you.
I don't care.
Look, they might be back any minute.
Are you with me, or your countrymen who killed everyone at Severnaya?
I've never been to Severnaya.
Your watch has.
Frozen by the GoldenEye blast.
And I'm willing to bet you're the one who climbed up the dish to get out.
Who are you?
I work for the British government.
The more you tell me, the more I can help you.
But I don't know anything.
Then start with what you do know.
My name is Natalya Simonova.
I was a systems programmer at Severnaya facility until...
Go on.
..until they killed everyone.
Who?
Alec Trevelyan?
No.
I don't know who that is.
Who's the insider?
Who's the traitor?
Boris.
Boris Grishenko.
KGB or military?
Computer programmer.
There was no one else?
No.
They're going to kill me, aren't they?
Trust me.
Trust you?
I don't even know your name.
Good morning, Mr Bond.
Sit.
I am Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin.
So, by what means shall we execute you, Commander Bond?
What, no small talk?
No chitchat?
That's the trouble.
No one has time to do a really sinister interrogation any more.
It's a lost art.
Your sense of humour doesn't slay me.
Where is the GoldenEye?
I assumed you had it.
I have an English spy, a programmer and a helicopter...
That's how your traitor wants it to look.
Who attacked Severnaya?
Who had the codes?
The penalty for terrorism is still death.
And for treason?
Stop it, both of you.
Stop it.
You're like boys with toys.
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.
I saw him do it.
Are you certain it was Ourumov?
Yes.
He killed everyone, then stole the GoldenEye.
And why would he do that?
There is another satellite.
Another GoldenEye.
Thank you, Miss Simonova.
What did you say about the lost art of interrogation, Mr Bond?
Defence Minister, I must protest.
This is my investigation.
You are out of order.
Molcheetye.
Molcheech.
From what I am hearing, it is you who is out of order.
I've seen this gun in the hand of our enemy.
Put it down, General.
Do you even know who the enemy is?
Do you?
Guard.
Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin, murdered by British agent James Bond, himself shot while trying to escape.
Guards.
Come on.
They're in the archive.
Down.
Spread out.
Cover the other side.
Trust me.
Go now.
Faster.
Damn it.
Down the alley.
Use the bumper.
That's what it's for.
Nazad.
What was that?
Go left.
Get out.
Either you've brought me the perfect gift, or you've made me a very unhappy man.
Mishkin got to them before I could.
Bond is alive?
He escaped.
Good for Bond.
Bad for you.
Take a seat, my dear.
You know, James and I shared everything.
Absolutely everything.
To the victor go the spoils.
You'll like it where we're going.
You may even learn to like me.
Svinya.
Stay with her.
Bond.
Only Bond.
He's going to derail us.
Full speed.
Shto?
Full speed.
Ram him.
Bye-bye.
Why can't you just be a good boy and die?
You first.
You second.
Up.
Situation analysis: hopeless.
You have no backup, no escape route.
And I have the only bargaining chip.
Where is she?
Ah, yes.
Your fatal weakness.
Ourumov, bring her in.
Lovely girl.
Tastes like...
Iike strawberries.
I wouldn't know.
I would.
So, back where we started, James.
Your friend, or the mission?
Drop the gun.
I'll let her live.
Ourumov, what has this Cossack promised you?
You knew, didn't you?
He's a Lienz Cossack.
It's in the past.
He'll betray you.
Just like everyone else.
Is this true?
What's true is that in hours you and I will have more money than God, and Mr Bond here will have a small memorial service with only Moneypenny and a few tearful restaurateurs in attendance.
So, what's the choice, James?
Two targets, time enough for one shot.
The girl, or the mission?
Kill her.
She means nothing to me.
See you in hell, James.
One-inch armour plating.
I'm fine, thank you very much!
Boris.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Boris is on-line backing up his files.
If I can spike him, I might be able to find out where they're going.
Don't stand there.
Get us out of here.
Yes, sir.
Good luck with the floor, James.
I set the timers for six minutes - the same six minutes you gave me.
It was the least I could do for a friend.
What does that mean?
We've got three minutes.
What else do you call your bottom?
What?
Boris'password.
He plays word games.
"What I sit on but don't take with me." Chair.
Like I said...
seconds.
He's not in Russia, Germany, Paris, London, Madrid,...
seconds.
New York, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco,...
seconds.
Mexico City, Rio, Miami...
Come on.
Wait.
He's in Cuba.
Havana no.
Now.
Do you destroy every vehicle you get into?
Standard operating procedure.
Boys with toys.
Maybe I should take care of the transportation for our trip to Cuba.
Our trip?
Do you know how to disarm the weapon?
I suppose that depends on what kind of weapon you're talking about disarming.
So, tell me.
Are there any other standard operating procedures I should be aware of, Commander?
Thousands.
But I only pay them Iip service.
My whole life I dreamed about coming to the Caribbean.
It's so beautiful.
Not another human being in sight.
What is it with you and moving vehicles?
Yo, Jimbo.
Brought a little gift from old whatshisname?
T?
Z?
Q.
Yeah.
What are you doing here, Wade?
Banyan trees.
I am not here.
The CIA has no knowledge, no involvement.
Nothing to do with your insertion into Cuba, if you catch my drift.
Yes, I do.
Borrowed the plane from a friend in the DEA.
The Coast Guard and the FAA are in the loop.
You're cleared on our radar for hours.
Here's the latest sat-int from Langley.
Stay below feet.
feet.
Who's that?
Natalya Simonova.
Sim-yo-nova.
Russian minister of transportation.
Did you check her out?
Head to toe.
Right...
So, you're lookin'for a dish the size of a football field, huh?
Doesn't exist.
Light a cigar in Cuba and we see it.
I know it's there.
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like your secret transmitters in New Zealand.
I've never been there.
How does she know about that?
What if I need backup?
Get on the radio.
I'll send in the marines.
Anyway, hang a left at the end of the runway.
Cuba's miles on your right.
Yo, Wade.
Just one thing.
Don't push any of the buttons on that car.
I'm just gonna bomb around in it.
Exactly.
Yo, James.
I got faith, but be careful.
He knows you're comin'.
He was your friend Trevelyan.
And now he's your enemy and you will kill him.
It is that simple?
In a word, yes.
Unless he kills you first.
Natalya...
You think I'm impressed?
With your guns, your killing, your death.
For what?
So you can be a hero?
All the heroes I know are dead.
Natalya...
How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?
It's what keeps me alive.
No.
It's what keeps you alone.
James...
Yes?
On the train, when you told him to kill me and that I meant nothing to you, did you mean it?
Yes.
Basic rule: always call their bluff.
No.
Turn ten degrees south, bearing .
Yes, sir.
Nothing.
There is nothing here.
Let's make another pass.
Maybe Wade was right.
There is no dish.
Natalya.
This time, Mr Bond, the pleasure will be all mine.
You wait for your turn.
She always did enjoy a good squeeze.
Is the satellite in range?
Six minutes.
Prepare the dish.
No.
It's too early.
I am not ready.
Do it.
No wonder we couldn't see it.
Come on.
The world's greatest cash card.
It had better not be rejected.
Mischa is on-line.
Sir.
Kill him.
The man just won't take a hint.
Target coordinates?
The target is London.
He's getting ready to signal the satellite.
How do you stop it?
The transmitter above the antenna.
Antenna in position.
On my count.
Three, two, one.
God save the Queen.
The mainframe computer.
Don't move.
James.
What an unpleasant surprise.
We aim to please.
Where's the girl?
Find her.
So, how is old Q?
Up to his usual tricks?
The watch.
A new model.
Still press here, do l?
Interesting setup, Alec.
You break into the Bank of England via computer, then transfer the money electronically just seconds before you set off the GoldenEye, which erases any record of the transactions.
Ingenious.
Thank you, James.
But it still boils down to petty theft.
In the end, you're just a bank robber.
Nothing more than a common thief.
You always did have a small mind, James.
It's not just erasing bank records.
It's everything on every computer in London.
Tax records, the stock market, credit ratings, land registries, criminal records.
In minutes and ...
no, seconds, the United Kingdom will re-enter the Stone Age.
A worldwide financial meltdown.
And all so mad little Alec can settle a score with the world years on.
Please, James.
Spare me the Freud.
I might as well ask you if all the vodka martinis ever silence the screams of all the men you've killed.
Or if you find forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women for all the dead ones you failed to protect.
England is about to learn the cost of betrayal, inflation-adjusted for .
Welcome to the party, my dear.
Natalya.
Don't ever do that again.
This is not one of your games, Boris.
Real people will die.
You pathetic little worm.
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.
She's a moron.
A second-level programmer.
She works on the guidance system.
She doesn't even have access to the firing codes.
Retro-rockets firing.
What the hell's happening?
We will have re-entry in minutes.
It will burn up somewhere over the Atlantic.
Deal with it.
She changed the access codes.
Then she can fix it.
Go ahead.
Shoot him.
He means nothing to me.
I can do it.
I can break her codes.
Then get on with it.
Tell him.
Now.
Give me the codes, Natalya.
Give them to me.
Can Boris break your codes?
Possibly.
Possibly?
We have to destroy the transmitter.
By the way, I'm fine, thank you very much!
Do you know how to use one of these?
Yes.
Good.
Stay out of sight.
How long?
Two minutes.
One minute.
Guard.
I'm fixing it.
If he moves, kill him.
Yes.
I am invincible.
You know, James?
I was always better.
Alpha One to Gunship.
Alpha One to Gunship.
Speak to me.
For England, James?
No.
For me.
Yes.
I am invincible.
James.
James.
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm fine.
Thank you.
Suppose someone is watching?
There's no one within miles, believe me.
Yo, Jimbo.
Is this supposed to be your idea of "coming through in a clinch"?
It's tobacco plants.
I said I'd be here, huh?
Yo.
Marines.
Maybe you two'd like to finish debriefing each other at Guantanamo?
Ready?
I'm not going on a helicopter with you.
No plane, no train, nothing that moves.
What do you call yourself?
Antonio Montana.
And you, what you call yourself?
Where'd you learn English, Tony?
In school.
And my father, he was from the United States.
Just like you, you know?
He was a Yankee.
He used to take me a lot to the movies.
I learned.
I watch the guys like Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney...
They teach me to talk.
I like those guys.
I always know one day I'm coming here, United States.
So where's your old man now?
He dead.
He die.
Sometime.
Somewhere.
Mother?
She dead, too.
What kind of work you do in Cuba?
You know, things.
I was, this, that.
Construction business.
I work a lot with my hands.
I was in the Army.
Any family in the States?
Cousins, brother-in-law, anyone?
Nobody.
Everybody's dead.
You ever been to jail, Tony?
Me?
Jail?
No way, no.
Been in a mental hospital?
Yeah.
On the boat coming over.
What about homosexuality, Tony?
You like men?
You like to dress up like a woman?
What is wrong with this guy?
He kidding me or what?
Just answer the questions, Tony.
Okay.
No.
Fuck, no!
Arrested for vagrancy?
Marijuana?
Never, man.
Heroin?
Cocaine?
No.
Where'd you get the beauty scar, tough guy?
Eating pussy?
How am I gonna get a scar like that eating pussy?
This was when I was a kid, you know?
You should see the other kid.
You can't recognize him.
And this?
What?
That's nothing.
That's for my sweetheart.
Sweetheart, my ass!
We've been seeing more and more of these.
Some kind of code these guys used in the can.
Pitchfork means an assassin or something.
You want to tell us about it, or you want to take a trip to the detention center?
Okay, you got me.
I was in the can one time.
For buying dollars.
Big deal.
That's pretty funny, Tony.
That's true.
It was a Canadian tourist.
Did you mug him first?
Get him out of here!
Come on!
So I fuck up!
Let me talk to this guy.
Please!
Let me talk to him a minute.
You a Communist?
How'd you like it?
They tell you all the time what to do, what to think, what to feel.
Do you want to be like a sheep?
Like all those other people?
I don't have to listen to this!
You wanna work fucking hours?
You own nothing, you got nothing!
Do you want a chivato on every corner watching everything you do?
Everything you say, man?
You know I eat octopus three times a day?
I got fucking octopus coming out of my ears.
I got fucking Russian shoes my feet's coming through.
How'd you like that?
You want me to stay there and do nothing?
I'm no fucking criminal, man.
I'm no puta or thief.
I'm Tony Montana, a political prisoner from Cuba.
And I want my fucking human rights, now!
Just like President Jimmy Carter says.
Okay?
Carter should see this human right.
He's really good.
What do you say?
I don't believe a word of this shit!
They all sound alike to me.
That Castro is shitting all over us.
Send the bastard to Freedomtown.
Let them see him.
Get him out of here.
You know something?
You can send me anywhere.
Here, there, this, that.
It don't matter.
There's nothing you can do to me that Castro hasn't done.
Get him out of here!
So?
So?
What'd you tell them?
I told them what you told me to tell them.
Told them we were, I was in sanitation.
They didn't go for it.
Sanitation?
Yeah.
I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.
Sanitarium.
Yeah.
You didn't tell me that.
No, I told you to say you had TB and you was in a sanitarium.
You was cured.
When did you tell me that?
You should've kept your mouth shut.
They'd think you was a horse and let you out.
Tony!
Montana!
Tony Montana!
Come here.
Come here, man.
I gotta talk to you.
Come on, man.
It's important.
So close, man.
Come on.
I gotta talk to you.
Where are you going?
Leave him alone.
I got better things to do.
You're chicken, man.
You almost made it.
Are you ready for some good news?
Sure.
What you got, man?
We can be outta this place in days.
Not only that, but we got a green card and a job in Miami.
Now are we made or are we made, man?
What do we gotta do?
Go to Cuba and hit The Beard, or what?
No, man, somebody else.
You're kidding?
No.
You're not kidding?
Guy named Rebenga, man.
Emilio Rebenga.
Rebenga?
I know that name.
Yeah?
He's political.
Yeah.
Well, he's coming in here today.
Castro just sprung him.
This guy was one of the top dogs for Fidel in the early days.
But Castro felt like he couldn't trust him anymore and threw him in jail.
But while he was on top, he tortured a few guys to death.
One of the guy's brothers is a rich guy in Miami now.
He wants the favor repaid.
That's where we come in.
It's ugly, man.
Yeah.
You tell your guys in Miami, your friend...
...it'd be a pleasure.
I'd kill a Communist for fun...
...but for a green card, I gonna carve him up real nice.
!
Libertad!!
Libertad!!
Libertad!
From a friend you fucked!
That face.
That's nice.
That doesn't look like me.
That looks pretty, man.
Fuck!
?
Qué paso, man??
Qué pasa, man?
Your big shot friend better come up with something soon.
I didn't come to the US to break my fucking back.
He's coming!
What do you want from me?
Fucking thing!
I told you.
What's wrong with him?
What's wrong?
More ham.
No more meat.
That's the way the sandwich comes!
Look at that one.
That one in the pink.
She's beautiful.
Look at those titties.
Look at that punk with her.
What's he got that I don't have?
Well, he's very handsome, for one thing, you know?
I mean, look at the way he dresses.
Come on.
That's style...
...flash, pizzazz.
And a little coke money doesn't hurt nobody.
Look at this.
Fucking onions.
I ought to be picking gold from the street.
There's two guys looking for you out there.
That's him, man.
That's El mono.
I told you.
Don't stay too fucking long.
We've got a lot of work to do, so...
Waldo, this is my friend, Tony Montana, I've been telling you about.
Tony, that's Omar Suarez and that's Waldo Rojas over there.
I got something for you.
Yeah?
What do we gotta do?
Gotta unload a boat.
Marijuana.
tons.
You get $ each.
$?
That's great.
You gotta be kidding.
$?
Who do you think we are, baggage handlers?
The going rate on a boat is $ a night.
You know that.
First you gotta work your way up to $ idiot.
After what I did for you in Freedomtown?
What was that?
That Rebenga hit was a game of dominoes?
That was something else.
Shut up!
Take it easy.
What's with this dishwasher, chico?
Don't he know we could've got another space cadet to hit Rebenga cheaper?
$!
Then why didn't you?
Don't call me no fucking dishwasher, or I'll kick your monkey ass.
Who the fuck are you?
You can't do that, man!
The Colombians!
Okay, all right, big man!
You want to make some big bucks?
Let's see how tough you are.
You know something about cocaine?
You kidding me or what?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday.
New guys.
They say they got two keys for us for openers.
Pure coke.
Hotel in Miami Beach.
I want you to go over there.
If it's what they say it is, you pay 'em and bring it back.
Do that, you get $ .
Go, pay them, bring it back, yeah?
You know how to handle a machine gun?
Yeah, man.
We were in the Army.
You gonna need a couple other guys.
That's no problem.
Be at Hector's Bodega at noon Friday.
You get the buy money then.
If anything happens to that buy money...
...my boss will stick your heads up your asses faster than a rabbit gets fucked!
I'm scared.
You're pushing your luck.
Don't worry.
That was dumb.
You worry too much.
You'll have a heart attack.
You act like that guy's doing you a favor or something.
What's this with the Colombians?
What does it matter?
He says "Colombians," and you make these eyes...
I don't like fucking Colombians!
Okay?
What you guys doing?
There's a lot of dishes to be washed.
Wash 'em yourself.
I retire!
What the fuck you gonna do now?
Don't come back here!
I gotta look after my investment!
Fuck you guys!
Close the shop!
Look at those tits.
She's begging for it.
Are you fucking crazy?
She's years old.
Not that one, man!
That one!
Which one?
The young one.
Move the fucking car.
We're at a stop sign.
We're just staying loose up here, okay?
You gotta stay loose.
You can't worry.
You'll have a heart attack.
Just play it cool.
Miami Beach.
Miami Beach!
The money stays in the trunk 'till I come out.
You got it?
Me, nobody else.
Okay.
I'm not out in minutes, something's wrong.
Okay?
Room .
You ready?
Sure thing.
How's it going, brother?
Come in.
What's wrong, man?
Okay.
You mind leaving the door open?
So my brother-in-law sees everything's okay.
Sure.
No problem.
No problem.
Hello.
This is Marta.
Marta, hello.
I am Hector.
And I am Tony.
So, Omar says you're okay.
Yeah?
Good.
Omar's okay.
Okay.
So, you got the money?
You got the stuff?
Sure I have the stuff, but I don't have it right here with me now.
I got it close by.
Well, I don't have the money either, man.
I have it close by, too.
Where?
In the car?
No, not in the car, man.
No?
How about you?
Where you have your stuff?
Not far.
Okay.
You want me to come in?
We start over again?
Where you from, Tony?
What the fuck difference does it make where I'm from?
Take it easy, man.
I just want to get to know who I do business with.
You'll know me once you do business with me and stop fucking around.
Okay?
What's the story?
Tony!
You know, Frog Face, you just fucked yourself.
You steal from me, you're dead.
Yeah?
You want to give me the cash...
...or do I kill your brother first...
...before I kill you?
Why don't you try sticking your head up your ass?
See if it fits.
Yeah?
Okay.
Yeah, it's very important.
I understand.
Important.
Thank you.
You forecasted an earthquake in the -to-point range this morning.
We had an earthquake in the -to point range this morning.
I'm impressed.
Thank you, sir.
However, isn't it rather slender evidence?
You have such beautiful skin.
I like the way you...
I don't what I'm supposed to do today, but...
Antonio, mira!
Watch what happens to your friend.
You don't want this to happen to you, give me the money.
Come on, come on.
Now the leg.
I'm going.
It's time.
Let's do it, man.
Come on.
We're all gonna be all right.
Okay, "Cara cicatriz." You can die, too.
It makes no difference to me.
Last chance, pendejo!
Fuck you!
You okay?
Yeah, man.
It went in and out.
Okay, take him out of here, quick!
Chi Chi!
Get the yeyo.
Your turn.
I kill you!
Die!
Hurry up!
Get in!
Come on.
Let's go!
Close the door!
Bunch of cowboys.
Somebody fucked up.
Yeah, well, I'll check it out right away.
You do that, Omar.
You do that.
You still got the money?
Yeah.
And I got the yeyo.
You got the yeyo?
Yeah, right.
Bring it here.
Fuck you.
I'm taking it to Lopez myself.
Not you, me.
Nice fucking guy.
Frank Lopez.
Tony Montana.
Tony Montana.
Mr Lopez.
It's a real pleasure.
You can call me Frank.
Everybody calls me Frank.
My Little League team.
Even the fucking prosecutors around town, they all call me Frank.
Okay, Frank.
How are you?
Manny Rivera.
He caught one on the job.
Went right through.
We heard about that.
Omar, he tells me great things about you guys.
Well, Omar's okay.
Not to mention, of course, the nice job you did for me.
That Commie son of a bitch...
Well, you don't have to mention that.
That was fun.
That was fun?
Damn right.
That was fun.
Sometimes it's fun.
What do you want to drink?
Scotch, gin, rum?
What do you like?
Gin is fine.
Want some?
Two gins.
I need a guy with steel in his balls, Tony.
A guy like you.
And I need him around me all the time.
You, Tony and your compadre here.
Here's the stuff.
Two keys.
It cost my friend Angel his life.
Here's your money.
My gift to you.
I'm sorry about your friend, Tony.
If people would do business the right way, there'd be no fuck-ups like this.
Don't think I don't appreciate the gesture.
You're gonna find you stay loyal in this business...
...you're gonna move up.
You're gonna move up fast.
Then you'll find out your biggest problem is not bringing in the stuff...
...but what to do with all the fucking cash!
I hope I have that problem someday.
You're gonna have that problem, don't worry.
Sit down over here.
Where the hell's Elvira?
It's late.
Go find her, will you?
Jesus!
Fucking broad.
She spends half her life dressing, the other half, undressing.
Gotta get her in between.
She's coming.
Yeah.
You gotta jump on her when she's not looking.
That's the best time.
What are you guys doing tonight?
You wanna go to a nice restaurant with me?
You hungry?
I could eat a horse.
Okay, they're gonna cook you a horse.
I'll eat it.
Tell me, where'd they get you?
Right there in the side?
It's nothing.
It went right through me.
It hit the wall.
I ran out of bullets like an asshole.
When I changed the clip, a guy who I thought I killed wasn't dead and shot me.
The guy was behind me.
I killed him.
How many bullets you catch?
Bullets?
One bullet, nine millimeter.
Elvira, where the hell you been?
It's : .
I'm starving.
You're always hungry.
You should try starving.
Where you going?
Come on.
Come over here!
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Tony Montana.
Elvira.
Hello.
Manny Rivera.
Elvira.
So, there are five of us.
Where are we having dinner?
I thought we'd go to the Babylon Club.
Again?
Again.
You know, Frank, if anyone ever wanted to assassinate you...
...you wouldn't be too hard to find.
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?
I got nothing but friends!
You never know.
Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.
The catcher?
That son of a bitch, he didn't get a base hit all season.
I should kill him!
You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echevarria.
They got the biggest distribution setup from here to Houston...
...Tucson, all down that way.
What do you think of that?
Look.
You see that fat bastard?
That's Nacho Contreras.
El gordo!
He's got more cash than anybody in this place.
He's a real chaza!
You know what a "chaza" is?
No, Frank, you tell me.
What is a "chaza"?
It's the Yiddish word for "pig." The guy wants more than what he needs.
He don't fly straight no more.
So, it comes down to one thing, Tony boy, and you never forget it.
Lesson Number : Don't underestimate the other guy's greed!
Lesson Number : Don't get high on your own supply.
That's right.
Lesson Number : Don't get high on your own supply.
'Course, not everybody follows the rules.
Your champagne, Mr Lopez.
That is '?
The best, Mr Lopez.
Omar, you pour it, and you bring another bottle right away, will you?
$ for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?
That's pretty good.
For a bunch of fucking grapes.
So, here's to old friends and to new friends.
How you like it, Tony?
That's good, Frank.
That's good?
Like you say, man.
That's good!
I'm gonna get you new clothes, too.
I'm gonna get you $ suits...
...so you look real sharp.
'Cause I want you to work for me.
I want you and your boys to work with Omar here.
We are going to do something big next month.
We are running a string of mules from Colombia.
You do good on that, there'll be some other things.
That sounds like fun to me, Frank.
You want a cigar?
So, you want to dance, Frank, or you want to sit here and have a heart attack?
Who?
Me, dance?
I think I want to have a heart attack instead.
Don't foam into the Dommie P.
How about you?
What?
You want me to dance?
Yeah, sure, go on, Tony.
You dance.
Go on.
Have some fun.
What do you think of him?
I think he's a fucking peasant!
But you get a guy like that on your side...
...he breaks his back for you.
What's your name?
What?
What's your name?
Elvira what?
Hancock.
What?
Hancock!
Hancock?
Sounds like a bird.
Hancock.
Flying around.
Where you from?
Baltimore.
What?
Baltimore!
Baltimore?
Where's that?
It doesn't really matter, all right?
I'm just trying to be friendly.
I don't need another friend, especially one who just got off a banana boat.
Banana boat?
Hold it.
You got the wrong guy.
I don't come off no banana boat.
You're thinking of someone else maybe.
Aren't you part of the Cuban crime wave?
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.
So take it easy.
Don't talk crazy.
Sorry.
I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.
What is your problem, baby?
You're good-looking.
You got a beautiful body, beautiful legs...
...a beautiful face, all these guys in love with you.
Only you got a look in your eye like you haven't been fucked in a year!
Who, why, when and how I fuck is none of your business, okay?
Now you're talking to me, baby.
That I like.
Keep it coming.
Don't call me "baby"!
I'm not your baby.
Not yet, but you gotta give me some time.
Even if I were blind...
...desperate, starved and begging for it on a desert island...
...you'd be the last thing I'd ever fuck.
That chick he's with.
Yeah?
She likes me.
She likes you?
How do you know?
I know.
The eyes, chico.
They never lie.
Are you serious?
Serious?
What do you think?
That's the boss's lady, okay?
You're gonna get us killed.
Fuck you, man.
The boss's lady.
That guy's soft.
Look in his face.
The booze and the concha tell him what to do.
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?
Just remember last year at this time we were in a fucking cage, okay?
You remember.
I'd like to forget that.
I say be happy with what you got.
You be happy.
Me, I want what's coming to me.
What's coming to you?
The world, chico...
...and everything in it.
This is paradise.
This is paradise, I'm telling you.
This town's like a great big pussy just waiting to get fucked.
I should've come here years ago.
I'd have been a millionaire by this time.
By this time, I'd have had my own boat, my own car...
...my own golf course.
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.
A line of blue jeans.
With my name written on the back of chicks'asses.
How's that?
That sounds completely crazy to me.
Look at that.
Look.
You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.
We're missing the action.
Want to have some ice cream with my friend and me?
Get lost, greaseball!
Look at that.
"Ice cream"?
That's right.
You said "ice cream"?
Girls like ice cream.
Come on, man.
That's not gonna work.
You can't do it that way.
You know how you pick up chicks in this country?
What was that?
What you just did?
That's what you do.
That's disgusting.
Watch.
Look at that.
You look like a lizard.
Like a bug coming out of your mouth.
That figures you wouldn't understand.
But the women in this country, when you do that, they know.
They know what?
They understand.
They go crazy.
It'll take practice, but you gotta learn.
Women love when you suck the pussy.
Look at that.
She's looking at us.
You think you can do it with her?
I think I can.
You want to try it with her?
Why not?
You gonna watch me?
I'm looking at you.
Go ahead.
You won't do it.
Watch this.
I'm with you, man.
I'm gonna get her.
Go ahead, Romeo!
Do your thing.
Just be quiet.
Just hang back.
Romeo!
You're looking very pretty today.
Yes, you.
I've been watching you.
You want to see something funny?
Take a look over there.
See that man?
Watch that guy.
I gotta sit down here.
I gotta watch my friend He gonna stick his tongue out to that girl.
Look at that.
You're sick!
You see what happened to him?
Lf I wasn't a nice guy, I'd crack you.
She's too big for you.
Causing trouble like that.
Come on.
Bitch!
What I try to tell you?
Lesbian!
What I try to tell you?
This country, you gotta make the money first.
Then when you get the money, you get the power.
Then when you get the power, then you get the women.
That's why you gotta make your own moves.
That's the one I rented.
No.
That's her, man.
There she is.
About time.
Frank got held up at the golf course.
He told me to pick you up.
He said he'd meet us at the track later.
He said to bet on Ice Cream in the first, by the way.
In that thing?
You must be kidding.
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Come on.
You know, I mean, it's got a few years, but it's a cream puff.
It looks like somebody's nightmare.
So, you like this better?
It's like one of them tigers from India.
Crazy guy.
Know what he's been doing?
Dragging me to the zoo to look at tigers.
He says he's gonna buy one.
You do that, and you won't have any friends left.
Not that you have any now.
You're gonna like that tiger, man.
You gonna drive around with a tiger in your passenger seat?
Maybe.
Some lady tiger.
How much?
$ fully equipped.
That all?
Machine-gun turrets are extra.
He's a funny guy.
Come here, Manny.
Bulletproof this, okay?
And this here and here.
And the windows.
Get me a phone with a scrambler.
And a scrambler.
And a radio with scanners, to pick up flying saucers, stuff like that.
Don't forget the fog lights.
In case I get caught in the swamp.
That's a good idea.
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!
I thought you were taking me to Frank.
We got an hour.
You hungry?
No, but I'm bored.
Well, that figures.
Check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.
And, you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?
Good doing business with you.
I wouldn't buy the car if you didn't like it.
Planning on driving the girls crazy, aren't you, Tony?
Yeah.
You know who?
And what would Frank say?
I like Frank, you know?
Only I like you better.
You got some for me?
Sure.
Don't get confused, Tony.
I don't fuck around with the help.
You wanna play that way with me, I play with you.
Shit.
Would you kiss me if I wear the hat?
No!
Playtime is over, okay?
Mama?
Long time.
No postcards from jail?
Gina.
Tony?
Look at you.
You're beautiful.
I didn't...
Mama, look at those eyes.
Look at that.
She looks like me.
You know the last time I saw you, you was like that.
You looked like a little boy.
But now look at you.
I got something for you.
It's no big deal.
I never thought I'd see you again, you know?
You think they'd keep a guy like me down?
Well, no.
You look so good.
Look, open that up.
Open it.
For me?
I think so.
It's nothing much, you know, nothing.
Do you see what's written on the back?
On the back?
"Always." "Always." It's beautiful, Tony!
Mama is still working in the factory and I work part-time in a beauty parlor.
I'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram Gonzalez?
His father owned that barbershop.
It's his place.
Plus I go to junior college.
Miami Dade.
And in two more years, I get my cosmetology license.
And then I'll be making enough money...
Surprise!
All that's over, starting today.
Why?
My kid sister don't have to work in no beauty parlor and Mama...
...she don't have to sew in no factory.
Your son made it, Mama.
He's a success.
That's why I didn't come around before.
I want you to see what a good boy I've been.
Here's $ .
For you, Mama.
Who did you kill for this, Antonio?
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.
No?
No.
What are you doing now?
Banks, or is it still bodegas, you and the others?
No!
Things are different now.
I'm working with an anti-Castro group.
I'm an organizer now, and I get a lot of political contributions.
Sure you do.
A gun sticking in somebody's face is how.
You know, all we hear about in the papers...
...is animals like you and the killings.
It's Cubans like you who are giving a bad name to our people.
People who come here, work hard and make a good name for themselves.
People who send their children to school.
What are you saying?
That's your son!
Son?
I wish I had one.
He's a bum.
He was a bum then and he's a bum now.
Who do you think you are?
We haven't heard a word from you in five years.
You suddenly show up here, throw some money around...
...and think you can get my respect.
You think you can buy me with jewelry?
Come on.
You think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes...
...and your jail manners and make fun of us?
You don't know what you're saying.
That's not the way I am!
That is not the way I raised Gina to be!
You are not going to destroy her.
I don't need your money.
I work for my living.
I don't want you in this house anymore!
I don't want you around Gina.
So, come on.
Get out!
And take this lousy money with you.
It stinks.
Why do you have to spoil it for everybody?
I'm sorry, Tony.
Okay, Mama.
No.
Tony, wait a minute!
Don't go, please!
Gina, stay here!
No, Mama.
He's no good.
Gina!
Tony, wait, please!
I'm sorry.
I don't know.
Mama, ever since Papa left she's...
Forget Papa.
We never had one.
I know you did some bad things back then.
In the Army, I know you got into some trouble.
The Communists, they're always trying to tell you what to do.
Mama doesn't understand that.
I know.
I just, I don't know.
I just want you to know that I don't care.
It doesn't matter to me how long you've been away, five or ten years.
You're my blood, always.
I know.
Come on.
I want you to take this.
I gotta go back in.
No, Tony.
Please.
You need this.
What will I tell her?
Take that.
You don't tell her anything.
Don't tell her I gave it to you, but give her some from time to time.
And listen, you go out yourself.
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.
You gotta get some fun out of life.
You gonna beat yourself to death at?
Pussycat like you?
Come here.
I'll talk to you again.
Okay.
Put the money away so she won't see it.
I'll talk to her.
I'll talk to you.
Let's go.
She's beautiful.
How come you...
Stay away from her, man.
You hear?
She's not for you.
So, this and my other factory, I can guarantee production...
...of kilos refined every month of the year.
The problem is, I have no steady market.
Basically, what I'm looking for is somebody in the States...
...who can share the risk with me, somebody who can guarantee...
...to buy from me, say, kilos a month.
That's a big commitment, Mr Sosa.
Something like that...
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.
It would've been nice if he'd come.
He would like to come...
...but with his trial coming up, it's hard for him to get out of the country.
So he sent you instead?
Something like that.
We'll talk at my house, shall we?
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.
So, this Lopez guarantees to buy from me kilos every month of the year.
He picks it up here.
I can sell it to him for as little as...
...$ a key.
You can't do better than that.
But then we got to take the risk of moving it.
We'll be cutting out the Colombians.
Know what that means?
That means we have to go to war with them.
We cut out the Colombians, we take risks on both sides.
Why don't we split the risk?
You guarantee your delivery, say, as far as Panama...
...we take it from there.
Panama is risky.
It costs me more.
Panama I can sell for $ a key.
$?
What, are you nuts?
$?
We still got to take that shit to Florida.
Do you know what that's like these days?
You got the fucking Navy everywhere.
You got frogmen.
You got ECs with the satellite-tracking shit.
You got the fucking Bell Assault Choppers up the ass.
We're losing one out of every nine loads.
That's no duckwalk anymore, let me tell you.
Forget about $ .
What do you suggest that is reasonable?
Excuse me.
One moment.
What the fuck's the matter with you?
You negotiating for Frank Lopez?
Don't worry about it.
Take it easy.
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.
If he wants to make a deal, it's up to him, not you.
We're gonna do this one deal.
That's it.
Fuck you.
How's that?
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
You need to open your eyes and keep your mouth shut.
That's it.
Let it go at that.
Don't worry about it.
Your head's in the wrong place.
You must watch out for yourself.
Why not talk to him?
You think he wants to give you the money?
Shut the fuck up.
I'm doing the talking here, not you.
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.
Better than your front, let me tell you.
That's easier to watch.
Close your mouth.
I can't wait to see what Frank's gonna react to this one.
Just shut up.
I'm doing the talking here.
Now where were we?
Panama.
You're looking for a partner, right?
Something like that.
Look, Mr Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here.
I am down on Frank's authority to buy keys, that's it.
That's my limit.
I got no right.
Nobody got no right to negotiate...
Let the man finish, okay?
Let him propose a proposition, then we can talk more.
You got no authority here.
I started you in this business, so shut the fuck up.
Frank is gonna love it.
That's up to Frank, not you!
I'm sorry about this, Mr Sosa.
No, it is all right.
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.
Well, good.
I don't think it's something I want to do on an overseas phone.
But as soon as I get back to Miami, I will talk to Frank personally.
Good.
My associates here can escort you to my chopper, to take you to Santa Cruz.
I have a jet there.
I can have you in Miami in five hours.
You'll be back here tomorrow in time for lunch.
Good.
Good talking to you.
Why don't you leave your friend here?
While you're gone, he can tell me how to run my business.
I think Frank would like to see him.
No, that's okay.
You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him.
I guess so.
Let's finish our lunch.
I have to hand it to you, Mr Sosa.
You got everything a man could want.
I like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.
Unfortunately, I do not feel the same about the rest of your organization.
What do you mean by that, Mr Sosa?
I'm talking about Omar Suarez.
This garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch...
...from several years ago in New York.
He was an informer for the police.
He put Vito Duval and the Ramos brothers, Nello and Gino, away for life.
So how do I know you're not a chivato, too, Tony?
Let's get this straight now.
I never fucked anybody over in my life who didn't have it coming.
You got that?
All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I don't break them...
...for no one, you understand?
That piece of shit up there, I never like him, I never trusted him.
For all I know, he had me set up and had my friend, Angel Fernandez, killed.
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.
You want to go on with me, say it.
You don't, then you make a move.
I think you speak from the heart, Montana.
But I say to myself...
...this Lopez, your boss...
...he had chivatos like that working for him.
His judgment stinks.
So I think to myself...
...how many other mistakes has this Lopez guy made?
How can I trust his organization?
You tell me, Tony.
Frank is smart, you know?
You can't blame him for that animal.
It's a crazy business we're in, you know?
That could happen to anyone, even you.
Why don't I go back and talk to Frank...
...and work it out?
I'll fix things between us.
You got my word on that.
I think you and me, we can work this thing out...
...and do business together a long time.
Just remember...
...I'll only tell you one time...
...don't fuck me, Tony.
Don't you ever try to fuck me.
You what?
You made a deal for a fucking $ million...
...without even checking with me?
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?
Coño.
Take it easy.
Coño, my ass!
At $ a key, it's puro.
You can't lose money.
No way.
We make $ million on this deal, Frank.
$ million.
That is serious money.
What is Sosa going to do when I don't come up with the first $ million?
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?
He'll send a hit squad up here!
There'll be a war in the street.
Relax!
Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.
You short a couple of million, I go on the street for you.
I make a couple of moves...
...a million here, a million there, you got it.
You've been making moves on your own?
I got ears, you know?
I hear things.
What do you hear about Echevarria and the Diaz brothers?
What about Gomez?
What is he gonna do when you start moving keys...
Fuck Gaspar Gomez and fuck the fucking Diaz brothers!
Fuck 'em all!
I'll bury those cockroaches!
What they ever do for us?
Look, Frank, the time has come.
We gotta expand.
The whole operation.
Distribution.
New York, Chicago, LA.
We gotta set our own mark and enforce it.
We gotta think big now.
"Think big." Like your friend Sosa.
Let me tell you something about that greaseball cocksucker.
He is a snake, that's what he is.
You turn your back on him, he'll stick it in.
You don't trust a guy like that.
You want me to believe...
...Omar was a stoolie because Sosa said so?
You bought that line?
Maybe I made a mistake sending you down there.
Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know.
Like what?
"Like what?" You tell me, "Like what." You calling me a liar, Frank?
That what you calling me?
Let's just say I want things to stay the way they are for now.
You stall your deal with Sosa.
Stall it?
Okay, Boss.
Come on.
I am the boss.
Sure, you're the boss.
Hey, Tony.
Remember I told you when you started...
...the guys who last in this business...
...are the guys who fly straight...
...low-key, quiet.
And the guys who want it all...
...chicas, champagne, flash...
...they don't last.
You finished?
Can I go now?
Hi, there.
You just missed Frank.
Too bad.
Only I didn't come to see Frank.
This is not the time or the place, Tony.
Next time, make an appointment first.
That's okay.
I got something important I want to talk to you about.
So why don't we have a couple of drinks...
...act normal...
...and just take it easy.
Come on.
I like scotch.
Sure.
Why not?
Okay.
I won't bite you.
We're all normal here.
I heard you and Frank aren't working together anymore.
That's right.
I think it's easier, don't you?
Makes things easier.
Thank you.
Here's to "the land of opportunity." For you, maybe.
You like kids?
Kids?
Kids.
You know, kids.
Little kids.
Sure.
Why not?
As long as there's a nurse.
Good, 'cause I like kids, too.
I like them.
Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.
Frank's gonna be back any minute.
Come here.
Sit here.
I want to talk to you.
Sit down.
I'm not gonna bite you.
Okay, here's the story.
I come from the gutter.
I know that.
I got no education...
...but that's okay.
I know the street, and I'm making all the right connections.
With the right woman, there's no stopping me.
I could go right to the top.
Anyway...
...what I got to tell you is this: I like you.
I liked you the first time I laid eyes on you.
I said, "She's a tiger.
"She belongs to me." Anyway...
...I want you to marry me.
I want you to be the mother of my children.
Me?
Marry you?
That's right.
What about Frank, Tony?
What will you do about Frank?
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.
Just think about it, okay?
I want you to really think about it.
I'll go now.
Take care.
All your enemies are gone.
Mr Montana.
How are you?
Hello.
What the fuck she doing here?
Come on, man.
She's just dancing.
Come on.
Take it easy.
It's just a disco.
Who's that guy she with?
He's some guy who works for Lugo.
He's nobody.
He's harmless.
Works for Lugo?
Yeah.
Forget him.
Hello, Tony.
Well, you remember me?
Bernstein.
Mel Bernstein, right?
Chief Detective, Narcotics.
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.
Talk?
What are we going to talk about?
I ain't killed nobody, not lately.
No, not lately.
What about ancient history, like Emilio Rebenga?
Or a bunch of whacked-out Indians at the Sun Ray Motel?
Whoever's giving you your information is taking you for a long ride.
Tony, baby, we gonna talk...
...or am I gonna bust your wise-ass spic balls, here and now?
Keep your eye on her.
I'll do that.
Okay.
My office.
Good.
The word on the street is you're bringing in a lot of yeyo.
That means you're not a small-time punk anymore...
...you're public property now.
Supreme court says that your privacy can be invaded.
Okay.
How much?
How much?
Well, there's an answer to that, too.
Here's how much.
Can you see it?
Big number.
Yeah!
That's on a monthly basis, same thing every month.
You know how this works?
No.
You tell me.
We tell you who's moving against you...
...and we shake down who you want shaken down.
Let's say that you got a real problem making a collection.
And then we step in for you.
Got eight killers with badges working for me.
When they hit, it hurts.
Same thing works the other way.
You feed me a bust now and then.
Some cowboy setting himself up in business.
Small-fry, you know?
We like snacks.
How do I know you're the last cop I'm gonna have to grease?
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro?
DEA?
How do I know what rock they're gonna crawl out from under?
Well, that's not my business, Tony.
We don't cross no lines.
Listen, you think I want this conversation...
...going any farther than this table?
My guys got families.
They're legitimate cops.
I don't want to see them embarrassed.
If they're embarrassed, they'll suffer.
If they suffer, they'll make you suffer.
You understand what I'm talking about?
Thanks for the drink.
By the way...
...I got a vacation coming up.
I'm gonna take the wife to London, England.
We've never been there.
So, throw in a couple of round-trip tickets, first class.
You ought to smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.
Every day above ground is a good day.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
Now that's the idea.
Okay, Mel.
You think about what I said?
About the kids?
You know, you are really nuts.
I'm nuts about you.
Tony, why don't you find your own girl?
My own girl?
Yeah.
That's what I'm doing.
Go do it somewhere else.
Get lost.
Maybe I don't hear so good sometimes.
You won't hear anything if you go on like this.
Will you do something?
You're fucking right I'm going to do something!
I'm giving you orders.
Blow!
Orders?
You giving me orders?
The only thing in this world...
...that gives orders is balls.
You got that?
Balls.
Let's go.
Elvira.
When you gonna learn?
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.
That cocksucker.
What happened?
He put that prick Bernstein on me.
Who?
Lopez did?
How do you know?
Who else knew about Rebenga?
Omar?
He's fertilizer.
He's letting me know he's got weight on me.
I'll tell you what, man.
You know our little trip we're been planning to New York?
It might be a good time.
Wait.
Where you going?
Welcome to my private room.
Your private room.
This is my private room.
I got a beautiful, nice, white lounge chair for you.
Gina, you taste so muy bueno.
What are you doing?
Shut up!
What?
We wasn't doing nothing!
Fernando, wait!
Get out!
Damn you!
You think he's cute?
I saw him putting his hand all over your ass.
My kid sister in a toilet.
It's none of your business.
None of my business?
Fuck it ain't!
You can't tell me what to do!
I am telling you!
Listen to me.
Come here.
I catch you here again, I'm gonna wipe you all over the fucking place.
Yeah?
Go ahead!
Do it now.
I want to see it.
I want to see it now, big shot.
Don't push me.
I want to see it now!
Don't push me!
Get outta here!
Go outside.
You got some nerve, Tony!
You think you can tell me what to do?
Get out.
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm not a baby anymore.
I'll do what I want to do, see whoever I want to see.
And if I want to fuck them, then I'll fuck them!
Fucking, man!
Come on, man.
What the fuck you want?
You want something?
No.
Don't touch me.
No.
We've got to get out of here.
Not there.
I don't want to go out there.
Another great night here at the Babylon?
Okay.
All right!
Do another gram, you'll all be babbling on.
That coke in your bra, or are you just glad to see me?
A little bit of hope, I'm sure, yes.
I'm in a good mood.
I was depressed when I got up this morning.
I had a dry dream, but I'm better now.
I do Laurel and Hardy in Spanish, too.
That's the height of culture, I assure you.
But my favorite Cuban of all time has to be Ricky Ricardo.
Mr Babalu himself.
He had the same problem for years.
"Lucy, don't come down to the club." He's your brother.
He loves you.
That's why he did it.
All right?
He cares about you.
To him, you're still his little sister...
Right!
That's the problem.
He still treats me like I'm a baby.
I'm years old now.
I'm not anybody's baby.
You're so grown-up.
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?
Right now, you happen to be the best thing in his life.
The only thing that's any good, that's pure.
Of course he doesn't want you mixing with those people...
...growing up to be like him.
He has this father thing for you.
Feels like he has to protect you.
Protect me against what?
Against guys like that asshole you were dancing with tonight.
I like Fernando.
He's a fun guy and he's nice.
And he knows how to treat a woman.
All right?
He knows how to treat a woman?
Yes.
By taking her to the toilet to make out?
You've been a great audience.
I got a special treat for you.
Here's a guy I found in the jungle.
From Caracas, Venezuela.
He's unlike anything you've seen.
Give a warm Babylon welcome to the one and only Octavio!
Look around.
Go out with someone who has something on the ball...
...who's going somewhere in life.
Like who?
Like, for instance, someone who's got a real job, like a banker.
Or, or a doctor, a lawyer...
What about you?
What are you talking about?
Why don't you take me out?
Are you crazy?
I see the way you look at me, Manolo.
Do you think I'm blind?
I see.
Come on.
What?
Look, Gina...
...Tony and I are like brothers, all right?
You're his kid sister.
So what?
That's where it ends.
That's where it stays.
Are you afraid of Tony?
You afraid of Tony's kid sister?
I'm not afraid of anybody!
That's not the point here!
It's not for me.
Don't look at me.
How do you know?
'Cause I'm not here.
Really?
Then where are you?
Shit, you're weird.
I'm weird?
Hello?
Hello, Miriam?
Tony!
Put Manny on, okay?
Okay.
Just a second.
It's Tony.
What are you doing, checking up on me?
Get your clothes on and meet me in front of Lopez Motors in minutes.
What?
What happened?
Nothing we can't face.
All right.
I'll be there.
You're still on the phone.
Let's go.
Take it easy, okay?
I'm leaving now.
Fuck.
Nick?
Yeah, Tony.
This is what I want you to do for me: You call Lopez.
Call him at his office at : sharp.
And you tell him, "We fucked up, he got away." Okay.
Yeah.
Got it?
What are you going to say?
"We fucked up.
He got away." What time?
: sharp.
So when are we gonna make some money on this thing?
Six months to start don't mean shit, Larry.
I'm not a Rockefeller, you know.
Not yet anyway.
So you owe me a quarter.
Listen, go down to the ball game tonight.
I couldn't make it.
I got things.
I'll tell you about them.
You're kidding?
What was the score?
Three to two?
Mel, guess what?
My Little League team, the Little Lopezers...
...they won the division tonight.
That's great.
Congratulations.
What'd you do, fix the umpire?
Jesus Christ.
Tony, what happened to you?
They wanted to spoil my $ suit.
Who the fuck did this?
Hitters.
I don't know.
Somebody must've brought them in.
I've never seen them before.
Hello, Mel.
Got an answer to this, too?
There always is, Tony.
I'll bet it was the Diaz brothers.
They got a beef going back to the Sun Ray thing.
Maybe you're right, you know?
Anyway, I'm glad you made it, Tony.
We'll return the favor for you, in spades.
No, I'll take care of this myself.
What is the gun for, Tony?
What, this?
It's nothing.
I'm...
How do you say?
Paranoid.
You gonna answer, Frank?
It must be Elvira.
She got mad after we left the club.
I'll tell her you're not here, okay?
No, it's all right.
I'll talk to her.
Hello.
It's all right.
I'm gonna be home in an hour.
Don't worry.
Frank, you're a piece of shit.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about...
...you fucking cockroach.
What are you talking about?
Listen to me...
You know what a "chaza" is, Frank?
That's a pig that don't fly straight.
Neither do you, Frank.
Tony, why the fuck would I hurt you?
I brought you in.
So we had a few differences, no big deal.
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.
I stayed loyal to you.
I made what I could on the side, but I never turned on you, Frank!
Never!
But you...
...a man who ain't got his word, is a cockroach.
Mel.
Do something, will you?
It's your tree, Frank.
You're sitting in it.
All right, Tony.
I was the one.
Please, give me a second chance.
Will you do that?
Please?
You give me a second chance, I'll give you $ million.
Okay?
$ million.
I got it in a vault over there in Spain, Tony.
We go over there, we get on a plane, and it's yours.
Okay?
All of it.
$ million.
Okay, Tony?
Please, Tony?
Elvira?
Elvira!
You want Elvira!
You can have her.
I'll go away.
I'm gonna disappear.
You'll never see me again.
Please, Tony, I don't want to die.
I never did nothing to nobody.
No, you never did nothing to nobody.
You had somebody else do it for you.
Tony, I am begging you.
Get up!
Get up now!
Jesus!
No!
God!
Look.
Tony, no, don't kill me, please.
I won't kill you.
Christ, thank you.
Get off my foot.
Thank you.
Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!
Every dog has his day, huh, Mel?
I told him...
...it didn't make any sense...
...clipping you when we had you working for us.
He wouldn't listen.
He got hot tonight about the broad.
He fucked up.
You, too, Mel.
You fucked up.
Don't go too far, Tony.
I'm not, Mel.
You are.
Fuck.
You can't shoot a cop!
Whoever says you was one?
Wait a minute!
You let me go.
I'll fix this up.
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can hand yourself...
...one of them first-class tickets to the Resurrection.
Fucking punk!
Son of a bitch!
So long, Mel.
Have a good trip.
Fuck you!
Okay, come on.
What about Ernie?
You want a job, Ernie?
Sure, Tony.
Okay, then you call me tomorrow.
Man, you got a job!
Tony!
Thanks.
God, what's happened?
Where's Frank?
Where do you think?
Come on.
Get your stuff.
You're coming with me.
So you come to me with some kind of thing.
Okay.
You propose it, I talk to you.
But we got a problem.
I can't pay more.
I'm bringing in twice as much as I ever did before.
We're doing $ million, $ million a month.
Come on.
That's serious money.
You bank boys gotta come down a bit.
No way.
That's crazy.
We can't do that.
Then that's too bad.
What am I gonna do?
We're not a wholesale operation.
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me...
...the harder it is for me to rinse.
That's a problem.
I didn't know.
The fact is I can't take any more of your money...
...unless I raise the rates on you.
You gonna raise...
I gotta do it.
The IRS is coming...
Don't give me that shit!
Let's talk.
I'm talking.
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.
This is business talk.
Let me explain something.
The IRS is coming down heavy on South Florida.
There was a Time magazine story that didn't help.
There's a recession.
I got stockholders I got to be responsible for.
I got to do it, Tony.
You'll learn from him.
I got to go percent on the first $ million in denominations of .
I'll go eight percent on your $ bills, six on your fives.
We'll go somewhere else.
That's it.
There's no place else to go.
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you!
I'll fly the cash myself to the Bahamas.
Once maybe.
Then what?
You'll trust some monkey in a Bahamian bank with $ million...
...of your hard-earned dollars?
Come on, Tony.
Don't be a schmuck.
Who else can you trust?
That's why you pay us what you do.
You trust us.
Did you hear that guy?
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.
Stay with us.
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.
And I got to run.
I'm safe but poor.
How's married life treating you?
Better than you are.
Say hello to the princess for me, will you?
She's beautiful.
I'll see you.
Take care.
You, too.
That prick!
Fucking WASP whore.
Talking to me like I'm some maricon who came over on a boat.
I tell you what.
We don't need that smiling motherfucker.
We should talk to this Jewish guy, Seidelbaum, okay?
He's got his own exchange.
He charges four percent at the most.
And he's connected.
Fuck them.
Mob guys.
Guineas.
I don't trust them.
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?
Yeah, I told you about it.
The $?
Look at that.
What?
That cable truck there.
Since when does it take three days to rig a cable?
What?
You been watching it for three days?
The thing has been there for three days.
What am I gonna do, not look at it?
What, you think it's cops, right?
I don't know.
Could be the Diaz brothers, coming to get me.
Maybe.
I'll check it out, okay?
You check it out.
Then we're gonna blow that fucking truck back to Colombia!
Come on.
We're not the only dopers living on the block.
Okay?
Remember that.
That truck could be anybody and anything.
It could be a cable company...
You know something?
You got some fucking attitude.
For someone who's in charge of my security...
...here are the keys to the front door.
Go down there.
Give them the keys!
I'm just trying to say something.
What?
You're spending a lot of money on this counter-surveillance.
I don't give a fuck.
It's percent of our adjusted gross.
percent is not peanuts.
I don't give a fuck!
It makes me sleep good at night.
That's what counts.
Okay?
You worry about it.
I am worried about it.
I'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.
Our thinking, our fucking attitude, you know?
We're not fucking hungry anymore.
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.
New construction.
New jobs.
Growth that's financed by Florida Security Trust.
We've put your money to work for years...
...building a more prosperous Miami.
Count on us being here tomorrow.
That's because for years you been fucking everybody.
Somebody should do something about those whores.
I mean, charging me points on my money.
They're getting away with it.
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.
Forget it.
Anything goes.
They been around years.
They got all the angles figured out.
You know what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.
True capitalist if ever I met one.
Did you hear that?
How would you know, Bubblehead?
You ever do nothing besides get your hair fixed and powder your nose?
Look at you.
You do too much of that shit.
Nothing exceeds like excess.
You should know that, Tony.
I should know what?
What should I know?
Why do you have to talk to me like that all the time?
Like I got to know something.
Let me talk to you.
Listen.
What time is it?
This Seidelbaum.
Five to : .
Okay.
I met with this guy Seidelbaum...
...the drug-related violence that's plagued South Florida...
He's good for a laugh, this guy.
With a small law-enforcement budget how can you put a dent...
...on an estimated $ billion-a-year business?
It seems at times all you can do is put your finger in the dike and pray.
Put your fingers in a dike?
The only place you can get your fingers is in some dyke.
Not by outlawing the substances, but by legalizing and taxing them.
These voices say that will drive out the organized crime element.
I am not one of those voices.
I know that.
But you know why?
'Cause you got your head up your culo, that's why.
That fucking guy, he never tells the truth.
...splendor of our city at its best.
It's those guys, man!
It's the fucking bankers, the politicians...
...they're the ones that wanna make coke illegal!
So they can make the fucking money, and they get the fucking votes!
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!
They fuck anything and anyone.
Can't you stop saying "fuck" all the time?
Can't you stop talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.
Where's this coming from?
Boring?
What's boring?
You're boring.
"Money." That's all I hear in this house.
Look at the pelican fly.
Come on, pelican!
Here it is.
Frank never talked about money.
That's 'cause he was so smart.
You know what you're becoming?
You're an immigrant spic millionaire who can't stop talking...
Who the fuck you calling a "spic," you white piece of bread?
Get out of the way of the TV!
Dig a hole in the yard, bury it, and forget about it.
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.
Somebody should've given it to you.
You would've been a nicer person.
Know what your problem is, Pussycat?
What is my problem?
You got nothing to do with your life.
Why don't you get a job or something.
Do something.
Be a nurse.
Work with blind kids, lepers.
That kind of thing.
Anything beats lying around all day waiting for me to fuck you!
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.
No?
Frank was better.
You're an asshole!
Where you going?
Come here!
Elvie!
I was kidding!
I was only kidding!
I guess sometimes married life is not all it's cracked up to be.
Where you going?
I got a date.
You got a date?
Come here.
What?
This Seidelbaum thing.
Yeah, it's all set up.
Yeah, well, you forget it.
Stay out of it.
I'll take care of it.
Stay out of it?
It's my deal.
I set it up.
You're not a negotiator, Manny, you know that.
You like the ladies more than the money.
That's your problem.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?
You're not gonna trust me with that kind of thing, who're you gonna trust?
Junior partner.
Bullshit, man.
Don't talk to me about trust, I don't like it.
You should listen to your wife.
She's right.
You are an asshole, man!
Come here.
Gimme a kiss.
Come here.
Fuck you, man!
Who put this thing together?
Me!
That's who!
Who do I trust?
Me!
Fuck him.
"Trust." Asshole.
Fuck called me an asshole.
I need that shit.
I don't need him.
I don't need her.
Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.
Back then I worked in pictures down in Colombia.
I was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?
You saw me with Marlon Brando.
You know we're good friends.
I was his driver.
No shit?
Brando.
They shot it there.
Cartagena.
Gillo Pontecorvo.
He was the director.
Italian guy.
Tell me about him.
I also know Paul Newman.
I worked with him in Tucson.
No kidding?
Do you know Benny Alvarez?
In Tucson.
Benny Alvarez?
Subtotal.
No?
He's a nice guy.
$ .
.
You want a company check here?
I got $ .
That's just not possible.
The machine don't make mistakes.
Let's count it again.
No.
Come on.
Business is business.
Come on.
You're talking $ here.
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay.
I don't give a shit.
I'll count it again for you.
No, come on.
This check here, where does this check go?
Montana Realty Company.
Montana what?
Montana Realty Company.
Montana Realty Company.
That's $ .
$ .
How come you don't know Benny Alvarez?
Me and Benny have lunch together.
He probably knows me.
You ask him.
We're up to what?
Seven checks.
$ .
$ more.
We ought to take a leak.
Freeze!
Get your hands up!
Go against the wall and turn around.
You're not kidding.
You're under arrest for violation of the RICO Statute.
"You have the right to remain silent.
Anything said will be used against you." How do I know you guys are cops?
What's that say, asshole?
That pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?
You call yourself a Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up!
Call your dog off me, Seidelbaum.
I want to call my lawyer.
Lot of good he's gonna do you.
You see that eye there in the clock?
Say, "Hi, honey." That's pretty cute.
Look at that.
You jerk off in front of us, Seidelbaum?
I was supposed to meet this chick at : .
You're a fucking pain in the ass.
All right, Danny, kill it.
You understand the rights I've given you?
I know all that bullshit, Seidelbaum!
Save your breath.
You got nothing on me.
You know it!
I know it!
I'm changing dollar bills, that's all.
You want to waste my time?
Okay.
I call my lawyer.
He's the best lawyer in Miami.
He's such a good lawyer...
...that by tomorrow morning, you gonna be working in Alaska.
So dress warm.
Give me a check for $ plus $ cash.
I guarantee you walk on the conspiracy charge.
But they're gonna come back at us on a tax evasion, and they'll get it.
So, what am I looking at here?
Five years.
You'll be out in three.
Maybe less, if I can make a deal.
Three fucking years!
For what?
Washing money?
The fucking country was built on washed money.
Can't be that bad.
It's not like Cuba.
What the fuck you talking?
The jails are like hotels.
You kidding me or what?
You fucking high or what?
I'll delay the trial.
Ayear and a half, two years.
You won't even start...
Fuck you, man!
I'm not going back in any cage, okay?
No way.
I been there.
Okay, look.
I give you $ more.
Okay, now that's $ .
With that kind of money, you can buy the supreme court.
Tony, the law has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
I'm an expert at raising that doubt.
But when you a got a $ ...
...undeclared dollars staring into a videotape camera...
...honey, baby, it's hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxicab.
I'm so glad you could come on such short notice.
I really appreciate it.
It's okay.
How's Elvira?
Great.
How's your wife?
Three more months.
Yeah?
Congratulations.
How about you?
When you gonna have another Tony to take your place?
I'm working on it.
You have to work harder.
Come.
I want you to meet some of my friends.
This is Pedro Quinn, chairman of the Andes Sugar Corporation.
Pleasure meeting you.
Nice to meet you.
General Edward Strasser, Commander of the First Army Corps.
Pleasure.
This is Ariel Bleyer with the Ministry of the Interior here.
And here is our friend, Charles Goodson from Washington.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do, Mr Montana?
Sit here, Tony.
Gentlemen.
I would like to discuss something that is of interest to all of us here.
You have a problem, Tony.
We have a problem.
I think together we can solve all our problems.
We all know you have tax troubles in your country...
...and that you may have to do a little time.
We have friends in Washington...
...who assure us these troubles can be taken care of.
You may have to pay some back taxes, a big fine...
...but there will be no prison.
Okay.
So what's your problem, Alex?
I'll show you my problem.
I've heard about financial support your government receives...
...from the drug industry in Bolivia.
Well, the irony of this is that this money, which is in the billions...
...is coming from your country.
You are the major purchaser of our national product which is cocaine.
On one hand, you're saying the US government...
...is spending millions to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets.
At the same time, we are doing business with the same government...
...that is flooding our streets with cocaine.
Let me show you a few of the other characters...
...that are involved in this tragicomedy.
My organization just recently traced a large purchase by this man.
This charming face here belongs to General Cucombre.
He is the Minister of the Defense of Bolivia, my country.
And General Cucombre just a couple months ago...
...bought a $ million villa on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.
Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister...
...what is he doing living in Switzerland?
Guarding cash registers?
This man here, Alejandro Sosa, a very interesting character.
He's a wealthy landowner, educated in England, very good family.
But this man is the business brain and drug overlord...
...of an empire that stretches across the Andes.
He's not your ordinary drug dealer.
Well, discussing it openly...
He's scheduled for Minutes next.
He is going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.
It's embarrassing, Tony.
That is our problem.
You remember Alberto, don't you?
How could I forget him?
Alberto is an expert in the disposal business.
He's going to help us fix our problem.
But he doesn't speak English.
He doesn't know his way around the States too well.
He needs a little help.
Is that a problem, Tony?
No problem.
Good.
So what's the big mystery with the Bolivian situation?
You gonna tell me what happened with Sosa, or what?
A lot of bullshit, that's what happened.
Politics.
I want you to stay down here for a while.
Run things for me.
I gotta go to New York next week.
Fuck this, man.
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.
You don't like it?
You the one that got me into this mess in the first place.
With that fucking Seidelbaum, that right?
With Seidelbaum?
What does Seidelbaum have to do with Sosa?
How do you connect those two?
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?
I'm not hungry.
You're not hungry?
Do you even know about the trial?
What did you order it for, then?
I lost my appetite.
Do you even know that Sheffield said he can get you a postponement?
Is this it?
That's what it's all about, Manny?
Eating, drinking, fucking, sucking?
Come on, man.
Snorting?
Then what?
Tell me.
Then what?
You're .
You got a bag for a belly.
You got tits, you need a bra.
They got hair on them.
You got a liver, and they got spots on it...
...and you're eating this fucking shit...
...and you're looking like these rich fucking mummies in here.
Come on.
It's not so bad.
It could be worse.
Is this what it's all about?
Forget it.
This what I work for?
Tell me.
Look at that.
Ajunkie.
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.
Sleeps all day with them black shades on.
Wakes up with a Quaalude...
Don't pick on her, man.
...and who won't fuck me 'cause she's in a coma.
I can't even have a kid with her, Manny.
Her womb is so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby with her!
You son of a bitch!
You fuck!
You shouldn't talk like that.
How dare you talk to me like that!
What makes you so much better than me?
What do you do?
Don't worry.
You deal drugs and you kill people.
That's wonderful, Tony.
Real contribution to human history.
Go ahead.
Tell everybody.
You want a kid?
Tell the world.
What kind of a father would you make?
Gonna drive him to school in the mornings?
Are you even gonna be alive by the time the kid goes to school?
You don't know how to be a husband!
Sit down before I...
Do we ever go anywhere without having six thugs hanging around all the time?
I have Nick "The Pig" as a friend.
What kind of life is that?
Can't you see...
...what we're becoming, Tony?
We're losers.
We're not winners, we're losers.
Go home.
You're stoned.
I'm not stoned, you're stoned.
Get her out of here.
Come on.
I'm not going home with you.
I'm not going home with anybody.
I'm going home alone.
I'm leaving you.
I don't need this shit anymore.
Okay, but I'll walk you out.
I'll take her home in a cab.
Let her go.
Another Quaalude, she gonna love me again.
What're you looking at?
You're all a bunch of fucking assholes.
You know why?
You don't have the guts to be what you want to be.
You need people like me.
You need people like me so you can point your fucking fingers...
...and say, "That's the bad guy." So...
...what does that make you?
Good?
You're not good.
You just know how to hide...
...how to lie.
Me, I don't have that problem.
Me, I always tell the truth.
Even when I lie.
So say good night to the bad guy!
Come on.
The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you.
Come on.
Make way for the bad guy.
There's a bad guy coming through!
Better get out of his way!
No.
You tell Sheffield to keep his nose out of it.
There's gonna be no trial.
I got it all under control now.
Just tell him to stay out of it!
Okay, what about Elvira?
Did she call?
Yeah, all right.
Tony, everything go okay?
Yeah, everything is roses.
Tony, what time do you got?
Ten to.
Ten to.
Where is this guy, man?
I gotta call Manny again.
You don't tell me what to do here!
He's coming out.
He's coming.
I don't give a fuck.
It's him, man.
I don't care where you blow him up.
Tell me when, okay?
You just tell me when.
That's all I care about.
I heard you the first time.
One time.
That's all you gotta tell me.
This fucking guy, I'm telling you.
Look.
Here he comes.
Where's he going?
What's he doing that way?
What the fuck he doing?
What the fuck is that?
Come here.
You said she took the kids in the other car!
She did every fucking day.
I don't know what's going on.
No fucking way.
No fucking way.
That's it!
This fucking guy.
Fuck you, you fucking vulture.
Two little kids in the car.
This is so fucking bad.
This is so fucking bad.
I see them, all right?
I see them!
Shut the fuck up, okay?
You don't have the guts to look them in the eye when you kill them.
You gotta hide with that shit.
He's getting up.
Let's do it.
Make you feel good?
Make you feel good to kill a mama and her kids.
Make you feel big.
Like you big man!
Fuck you!
What do you think I am?
You think I kill two kids and a woman?
Fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life!
You die, motherfucker!
What do you think I am?
You think I'm a fucking worm like you?
I told you, man!
I told you, don't fuck with me!
I told you, no fucking kids!
No, but you wouldn't listen!
You stupid fuck!
Look at you now.
Nick, where the fuck you been?
On a delivery?
Where the hell is Manny?
I been calling all over.
Where is he?
I don't know, Tony.
He's been gone the last couple of days.
He didn't say nothing.
He's gone?
What?
Where?
I left him in fucking charge, man!
Where the fuck is he?
You can't trust nobody anymore!
I don't know, Tony.
He just took off.
He didn't say nothing.
He took off?
Are you all right?
No, I'm not all right!
I'm pissed!
When I get back there, I'll kick some ass all over the place!
When you coming back?
I'm coming back tonight!
This fucking cocksucker.
Tony, your mama called.
Gina's gone.
Gone?
Where?
She got to see you right away.
Okay, just tell her I'll call her tonight.
Listen to me.
What about Elvie?
She call?
No.
No?
Okay, listen to me.
If she calls, just tell her I love her.
Okay?
Just tell her that.
You hear from Manny?
No.
Your mama called, she gotta see you.
And Sosa has been ringing every half hour.
He sounds pissed.
Get him on the phone.
Elvie call?
No.
You keep trying Manny.
I want that cocksucker here.
I want him here now!
Okay?
Okay.
Come on.
Go ahead, get him!
Let's go.
Come on!
Yeah?
Mama.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
They told me.
Okay.
I'm coming over.
I'll be over to see you.
I'll be over, yeah.
Put it on the speaker.
What happened, Tony?
Alex, how you doing?
What happened?
We had some problems.
Alex?
Tony, what happened?
We had a little problem.
I heard.
How you hear that?
Our friend gave a speech at the UN.
He was not supposed to give that speech.
Well, your guy, Alberto, he's a piece of shit.
I told him to do something.
He didn't listen, so I canceled his contract.
My partners and I are pissed off, Tony.
That's okay.
No big deal.
There's other Albertos.
We'll do it next month.
No, Tony, you can't do that.
They found what was under the car, Tony.
Now our friend has got security up the ass...
...and the heat is gonna come down hard on my partners and me.
There's not gonna be a next time...
...you dumb cocksucker!
You blew it!
Take it easy when you talk to me.
I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!
Who the fuck you think you're talking to?
You want to fuck with...
Who the fuck you think I am, your fucking bellboy?
You want to go to war?
We take you to war, okay?
Alex, you there?
Hey!
He's not there.
Calmate, man.
She got a place of her own.
She don't tell me where.
One night, I follow her in a taxi.
She goes to a fancy house, Coconut Grove.
Where'd she get the money?
You!
You were giving her the money!
You see what you do to her?
I don't give her that kind of money.
You did!
One time, $ you gave her.
Was a guy with her?
I don't know.
There was this car in the driveway.
I know if I go there, she'll kill me.
She's like you.
Where's the place?
Where is it?
something.
Citrus Drive.
what?
I think.
You gotta talk to her, Antonio.
She don't listen to me.
She says to me, "Mira, shut up!
Mind your own business." Exactly like you do.
Ever since you came back, she's been getting this way.
I gotta go.
Why do you have to hurt everything?
Why do you have to destroy...
...everything that comes your way?
Citrus Drive.
Tony, I can't find Manny anywhere.
Fuck!
Okay.
Listen, Boss, I'll try again.
You stay here.
Keep trying Manny, okay?
We got married just yesterday.
We were gonna surprise you.
Jesus, Tony.
Tony, we gotta get outta here, man.
We gotta get outta here.
Go get Gina.
No!
No, Gina.
Come on, Gina.
No!
God!
Tony, we can't stay here.
We gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.
Come on, Gina.
Here we go.
It's gonna be okay.
You got her?
I got her.
No!
This is Tony's place!
Let me go!
We put some pills into her.
She's gonna be all right, Tony.
She's cooling down.
Right?
She's gonna be fine.
Just fine.
Right.
What are we gonna do now?
Do?
We're going to war.
That's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna eat that Sosa for breakfast!
Close that fucker down.
Tony.
Take it easy.
All right, Ernie.
Let's go.
We'll take care of the house.
Come on.
This cocksucker's gonna run all over you.
Come on.
I'll bury these cocksuckers.
We gotta get organized here.
Fuck!
Manny.
How the fuck I do that?
How the fuck I do that, Manny?
Is this what you want, Tony?
You can't stand for another man to be touching me.
So you want me, Tony?
What are you talking?
Is that it?
Here I am, Tony.
I am all yours now, Tony, you see?
I'm all yours now.
You better come and get me now.
All right.
Come on.
Come and get me.
Come and get me.
You do it now before it's too late.
Come on, Tony.
Fuck me.
Fuck me.

Look at your face.
It's all dirty.
Please talk to me.
Don't be mad at me.
Please.
Gina.
Come on.
I love Manny, you know?
I love him.
And I love you, too, you know?
Gimme a smile.
They're coming from everywhere!
Tony, open up!
Open the fucking door!
Please!
Tony!
Let me in, Boss!
Please!
Tony, open the fucking door!
You wait here, okay?
I'll be with you.

Okay, Sosa.
You want to fuck with me?
You're fucking with the best!
You want to fuck with me?
You cockroaches.
You want to play games?
Okay, I play with you.
You wanna play rough?
Say hello to my little friend!
You want to play rough?
There!
You like that?
You want more?
You whores!
Cowards!
Want to fuck with me?
Go ahead!
Die!
How'd you like that?
You fucking maricon!
You think you can take me?
You need a fucking army, if you gonna take me!
You hear?
Come on!
I take you all to fucking hell!
Who you think you fucking with?
I'm Tony Montana!
You fuck with me, you fucking with the best!
I'm still standing.
Come on!
I take your fucking bullet!
Come on!
I take your fucking bullet!
You think you kill me with bullets?
I take your fucking bullets!
October is inventory time. So right now, Statler Toyota is making the best deals of the year on all 1985 model Toyotas. You won't find a better car with a better price with better service anywhere in Hill Valley...
The Senate is expected to vote on this today. In other news, officials at The Pacific Nuclear Research Facility have denied the rumor that the case of missing plutonium was in fact stolen from their vault two weeks ago. A Libyan terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the alleged theft, however, the officials now infer the crepency to a simple clerical error. The FBI...
Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo
Marty, is that you?
Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?
Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at
I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
in the morning?
Yeah.
What's going on? Where have you been all week?
Working.
Where's Einstein, is he with you?
Yeah, he's right here.
You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.
My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.
Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now,
a.m., Twin Pines Mall.
Right.
Are those my clocks I hear?
Yeah, it's

They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's

Precisely.
Damn. I'm late for school.
Hello, Jennifer.
Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row.
Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.
Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.
Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nuttcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble.
Oh yes sir.
You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too.
Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?
I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.
Yeah, well history is gonna change. Audition
Next, please.
Alright, we're the pinheads. Audition
Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please. Election
Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.
I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.
Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.
Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music.
But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.
Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.
That's good advice, Marty.
Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, "Get out of here, kid, you got no future." I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man.
C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.
Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars.
Stop it.
What?
Does your mom know about tomorrow night?
No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun.
She's just trying to keep you respectable.
Well, she's not doing a very good job.
Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage.
Here you go, lady. There's a quarter.
Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer.
Right.
Save the clock tower.
Where were we.
Right about here. Jennifer's
Jennifer.
It's my dad.
Right.
I've gotta go.
I'll call you tonight.
I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye.
Perfect, just perfect.
I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed.
Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son.
But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?
Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage?
My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?
Uh?
And where's my reports?
Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till-
Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to get them re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting. I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you?
Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright?
Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me.
I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.
The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue?
I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry.
Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance.
He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches.
Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line.
Uncle Jailbird Joey?
He's your brother, Mom.
Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.
We all make mistakes in life, children
God dammit, I'm late.
David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.
C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil.
Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice.
I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble.
Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.
I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy.
Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody.
Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father.
That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car.
It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.
Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.
What was it, George, bird watching?
What Lorraine, what?
Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him.
Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance.
No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him.
Hello.
Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?
Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.
Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?
Um, yeah, I'm on my way.
Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh? Doc
Marty, you made it.
Yeah.
Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life.
Um, well it's a deloreon, right?
Bare with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.
Doc, is that a de-
Never mind that now, never mind that now.
Alright, I'm ready.
Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985,
a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it.
Whoa, whoa, okay.
Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch.
Right check, Doc.
Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.
You have this thing hooked up to the car?
Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly
a.m. and zero seconds.
Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein.
Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact.
Where the hell are they.
The appropriate question is, weren't the hell are they. Einstein has just become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into the future. One minute into the future to be exact. And at exactly
a.m. we should cat h up with him and the time machine.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a deloreon.
The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out.
What, what is it hot?
It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking.
He's alright.
He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.
What, I don't get what happened.
That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.
The flux capacitor.
It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.
This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?
Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.
Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you telling me that this sucker's nuclear?
Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.
Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off?
Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts.
Jesus.
Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload.
Safe now, everything's let lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics.
The future, it's where you're going?
That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series.
Uh, Doc.
Huh?
Uh, look me up when you get there.
Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.
Who, who?
Who do you think, the Libyans.
Holy shit.
Unroll their fire.
Doc, wait. No, bastards.
Go. Go.
C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety.
Ahh. Ahh.
Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?
Looks like a airplane, without wings.
That ain't no airplane, look. Mother &
Ahh.
Children.
Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn.
It's already mutated intro human form, shoot it.
Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine.
Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me.
Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.
Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon. Election
Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...
this has gotta be a dream.
Hey kid, what you do, jump ship?
What?
What's with the life preserver?
I just wanna use the phone.
Yeah, it's in the back.
Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside-
Are you gonna order something, kid?
Yeah, gimme a Tab.
Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something.
Right, gimme a Pepsi free.
You wanna a Pepsi, pall, you're gonna pay for it.
Well just gimme something without any sugar in it, okay?
Without any sugar.
Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing.
Biff.
Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug.
Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing?
Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly?
Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-
Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you?
Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.
Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head?
Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown.
Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?
Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.
Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly.
Okay.
I don't wanna see you in here again.
Yeah, alright, bye-bye. What?
You're George McFly.
Yeah, who are you?
Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that?
Well, they're bigger than me.
Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?
Watch it, Goldie.
No sir, I'm gonna make something out of myself, I'm going to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.
That's right, he's gonna be mayor.
Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor.
A colored mayor, that'll be the day.
You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town.
Good, you could start by sweeping the floor.
Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.
Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike.
He's a peeping tom. Dad.
Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house.
Mom, is that you?
There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.
I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible.
Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955.
1955? You're my ma- you're my ma.
My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines.
Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.
Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head.
Ah, where're my pants?
Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.
Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin?
Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?
Actually, people call me Marty.
Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here?
No, fine, no , good, fine, good.
That's a big bruise you have there.
Ah.
Lorraine, are you up there?
My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on.
So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?
Excuse me.
Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver.
Uh, coast guard.
Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god.
What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age.
Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.
So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.
yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.
Well, uh, listen, uh, I really-
Sit here, Marty.
Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner.
Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.
Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?
Well yeah, you know we have two of them.
Wow, you must be rich.
Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.
Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space.
What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.
Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.
What's a rerun?
You'll find out.
You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?
Yeah, I think maybe you do.
Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you.
You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home.
Oh.
Yet.
Oh.
Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is?
It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple.
A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive.
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?
Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car.
That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility.
Well gee, I don't know.
And he could sleep in my room.
I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later.
He's a very strange young man.
he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.
Doc?
Don't say a word.
Doc.
I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you.
Listen, Doc.
Quiet.
Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty.
Don't tell me anything.
Doc, you gotta help-
Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance?
Yeah, exactly.
Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?
No.
Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?
Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.
My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.
Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works.
Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.
Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984.
Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair.
I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me.
So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985?
Ronald Reagon.
Ronald Reagon, the actor? Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wymann is the first lady.
Whoa, wait, Doc.
And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury.
Look, you gotta listen to me.
I got enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.
No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.
Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it.
After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.
Flux capacitor.
It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works.
Bet your ass it works.
Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.
Okay Doc, this is it. TV
Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind-
Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man. TV
Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of-
Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?
Well, this is a radiation suit.
Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fall out from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.
whoa, this is it, this is the part coming up, Doc. TV
No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity-
What did I just say? TV
No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need.
One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott.
What the hell is a gigawatt?
How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't.
Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium.
I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.
whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.
Is she pretty?
Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.
What did you say?
A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike.
We do now.
This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at
p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future.
Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around.
Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious reprocautions on future events. Do you understand?
Yeah, sure, okay.
Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?
Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents.
Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.
His head's gone, it's like it's been erased.
Erased from existence.
Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.
Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next.
This sounds pretty heavy.
Weight has nothing to do with it.
Which one's your pop?
That's him.
Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature.
Maybe you were adopted.
Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books?
McFly.
That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?
Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life?
No.
What did your mother ever see in that kid?
I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car.
That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.
Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been looking all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day.
Yeah.
Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Loraine.
Calvin.
I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.
Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you.
How's your head?
Well uh, good, fine.
Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat?
Doc, she didn't even look at him.
This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father.
Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me?
Precisely.
Whoa, this is heavy.
There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?
What?
The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social-
What, well you mean like a date?
Right.
What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties?
Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are there common interests. What do they like to do together?
Nothing.
Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.
Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time.
Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance.
George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Loraine. What are you writing?
Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.
Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some.
Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories.
Why not?
Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand.
Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Loraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance.
Really.
oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.
What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What is she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.
Who?
Biff.
C'mon, c'mon.
Leave me alone.
You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you.
Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl.
Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet.
Get your meat hooks off of me.
You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please.
So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.
George.
Why do you keep following me around?
Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Loraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.
But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.
Yeah but George, Loraine wants to go with you. Give her a break.
Look, I'm just not ready to ask Loraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.
Science Fiction Theater.
Who are you?
Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.
Marty. Marty. Marty.
Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day?
I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Loraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Loraine out but I don't know how to do it.
Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the café. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George?
Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Loraine, that he'd melt my brain.
Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her.
Okay, but I don't know what to say.
Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.
Nothing's coming to my mind.
Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.
What, what?
Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?
I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.
Yeah okay.
Oh.
Let's go.
Oh.
Will you take care of that?
Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Loraine, my density has popped me to you.
What?
Oh, what I meant to day was-
Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?
Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny.
Oh.
Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you?
Well, Biff.
Alright, punk, now-
Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?
That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream.
Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Hey.
I'll get it back to you, alright?
You broke it. Wow, look at him go.
Let's get him.
What's that thing he's on?
It's a board with wheels.
He's an absolute dream.
Ah. Whoa.
I'm gonna ram him. Biff, Matches, 3-D, &
Shit.
Thanks a lot, kid.
I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch. Girlfriend
Where does he come from? Girlfriend
Yeah, where does he live?
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.
Doc.
Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.
Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape.
Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.
You don't understand.
I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.
Your, your right.
Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.
Its good.
Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at
pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh.
You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.
Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out?
Uh, I think so.
What did she say? It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.
Hi, Marty.
Uh, Loraine. How did you know I was here?
I followed you.
Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.
Hi.
Hello.
Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday.
Uh, you mean nobody's asked you?
No, not yet.
What about George?
George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you?
Yeah.
I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.
Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.
Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life.
Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again.
where are you gonna be.
I'm gonna be at the dance.
Right, and where am I gonna be?
You're gonna be in the car with her.
Right, okay, so right around
she's gonna get very angry with me.
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.
Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her-
No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so
you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George.
Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear?
Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Loraine live happily ever after.
Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.
George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.
This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.
Are you sure about this storm?
When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.
You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.
I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future-
No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.
Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.
Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?
Oh, just a little weather experiment.
What you got under here?
Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment.
You got a permit for that?
Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it.
Do you mind if we park for a while?
That's a great idea. I'd love to park.
Huh?
Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.
What?
Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong?
No no. Loraine, Loraine, what are you doing?
I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.
Yeah well, you shouldn't drink.
Why not?
Because, you might regret it later in life.
Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.
Jesus, you smoke too?
Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Marvin
We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where.
Marty, why are you so nervous?
Loraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?
Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date.
Ah well, sort of.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
You do?
You know what I do in those situations?
What?
I don't worry. this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?
Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense.
You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.
Let him go, Biff, you're drunk.
Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me.
Stop it.
C'mon.
Stop it.
C'mon.
Leave her alone, you bastard.
You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show.
Let's put him in there.
Yeah.
That's for messing up my hair.
The hell you doing to my car?
Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Marvin
Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood.
Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?
C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Marvin
Lorenzo, where're you keys?
The keys are in the trunk. Marvin
Say that again.
I said the keys are in here.
Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh.
I think you got the wrong car, McFly.
George, help me, please.
Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.
No, Biff, you leave her alone.
Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it.
Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Marvin
Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand.
Who's are these?
Thanks, thanks a lot.
You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go.
Are you okay?
Who is that guy.
That's George McFly.
That's George McFly?
Excuse me.
The storm.
Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.
Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him.
Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. Marvin
Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Marvin
This is for all you lovers out there.
George, aren't you gonna kiss me?
I, I don't know. Obnoxious
Scram, McFly.
Hey boy, are you alright?
I can't play.
George. George.
George.
Excuse me. Marvin
Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.
Uh, well, I gotta go. Marvin
C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks.
Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay.
Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going.

you ever think of running for class president? Marvin
John, John, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Barry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this.
I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.
Loraine.
Marty, that was very interesting music.
Uh, yeah.
I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.
Great good, good, Loraine, I had a feeling about you two.
I have a feeling too.
Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.
Marty, will we ever see you again?
I guarantee it.
Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advise, I'll never forget it.
Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.
Okay.
Marty, such a nice name.
Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time?
Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked.
What?
He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.
Never?
No, why, what's a matter?
Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.
Right.
Well, I guess that's everything.
Thanks.
Thank you. In about thirty years.
I hope so.
Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine.
Right.
What's the meaning of this.
You'll find out in thirty years.
It's about the future, isn't it?
Wait a minute.
It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.
Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it.
No, I refuse to except the responsibility.
In that case, I'll tell you strait out.
Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.
Right, I got it.
Ahh.
Doc.
C'mon, c'mon let's go.
Alright, take it up, go. Doc.
Huh?
I have to tell you about the future.
Huh?
I have to tell you about the future.
Ahh.
On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc.
Ohh, no.
No, Doc.
Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.
Yeah.
Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.
Ahh.
Doc.
Yoo.
Crazy drunk drivers.
Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great.
I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans.
No, bastards.
Go.
Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum.
Well, I figured, what the hell.
About how far ahead are you going?
About 30 years, it's a nice round number.
Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47.
I will.
Take care.
You too.
Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.
You bet.
What a nightmare.
Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.
Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.
Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?
I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.
What the hell is this?
Breakfast.
What did you sleep in your clothes again last night.
Yeah, yeah what are you wearing, Dave.
Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?
Yeah.
I think we need a rematch.
Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating?
No.
Hello.
Good morning.
Mom, Dad.
Marty, are you alright?
Did you hurt your head?
you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.
Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda
Good morning, Mom.
Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.
Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?
What, what, ma?
Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks.
Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked.
Wrecked?
Wrecked? When did this happen and-
Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.
Why am I always the last one to know about these things.
See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.
Just finishing up the second coat now.
Now Biff, don't con me.
I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.
That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him-
We never would have fallen in love.
That's right.
Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.
Ah, honey, your first novel.
Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.
Oh, oh Marty, here's you keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.
Keys?
How about a ride, Mister?
Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you.
Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.
I haven't
You okay, is everything alright?
Aw yeah, everything is great.
Marty you gotta come back with me.
Where?
Back to the future.
Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?
I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car.
No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.
Well, bring her along. This concerns her too.
Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?
No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.
Malibu's Most Wanted Growing up in the streets ain 't no joke.
There's crazy crime...
drugs...
and mad violence.
Yeah, the streets is tough.
But there ain 't no streets tougher than mine.
The streets of...
Malibu.
It's hardcore up in the 'Bu, y'all.
It's just part of the everyday struggle.
Things go down here people should never see.
We got bag ladies...
big ballers...
everybody strapped with a .
This is my ghetto.
The mall.
Most of the time the police won 't even come through.
We got all sorts of sets up in here.
We got the beach boys...
the A CCs: the Abused Children of Celebrities...
and this is my crew.
That's my boy Mocha.
That brother straight-up crazy.
He did time in public school!
That there is Hadji.
He's the Beast from the Middle East.
And that's Monster.
She had a big chip on her shoulder...
till she ate it.
Hey, that's me!
B-Rad G.
I run things around here.
Now, sometimes bustas be disrespecting.
And you can 't punk out, no matter what the devil may bring.
Hey, yo, fool!
We about to have some hardcore drama go down right about now!
That's right!
This our mall.
Always has been, always will be.
Mr Amerislani.
Our clerk accidentally gave you the wrong aromatherapy candles.
Here you go!
You validate parking?
Of course, sir.
That's what I'm talking about!
We get ours!
That's my crib.
It ain 't much, but it's all I got.
If you elect me governor....
That's my pops, Bill Gluckman.
He getting his campaign on.
I got mad love for the man, but he 's old-school.
He needs to bring his word to the street.
That's where I come in.
You see, friends...
California is my family.
And speaking of family, I want to introduce my wife, Bess.
And my daughter, little Brenda.
Where's your son Brad?
Yes, sir, where is he?
Thank you for your questions.
Unfortunately, we are out of time for today.
Yo, what's up, y'all?
This is B-Rad G, kicking it from 'Bu.
Represizzent!
Hi, Pops, it's me!
B-Rad!
Hi, Brad.
Show's over!
That's it.
Show's over!
See that?
I know how to get the party started!
And I know my pop was loving it.
It's a disaster!
The Times and the Chronicle will run it as a big joke.
Thank God!
How did this happen?
I have no idea.
I didn't even know he was in town!
We can't keep tabs on this kid?
Can anybody tell me where he is?
That was off the hinges!
I just got you another million votes right there!
What you doing here, son?
I knew I had to show up in order for you to blow up!
So I called up Captain Tony, he fired up the Lear jizzy...
and boo-yah!
I'm in the hizzy.
I'll be on the campaign trizzy too.
/ .
You know, kissing babies and whatnot.
Pound it.
Yeah, all good.
Tom, you down, you gots....
Okay, dude.
I'll let you all do your campaign thing.
Oh, Bill....
You need to shut this down.
Tell your son that he cannot be in your campaign, period.
Wait a minute.
I love his enthusiasm.
It's a little misguided, but....
Isn't there something he can do for the campaign where he can't hurt us?
No.
Phones?
No.
Stuffing envelopes?
Making signs?
Signs.
In Bill Gluckman's administration...
women are going to have better health care.
Women are going to have better daycare!
And women will have better jobs!
In fact, after today, my campaign has a new slogan: " Bill Gluckman is down with the bitches and the ho's"?
It was supposed to have read "Women are first with Gluckman." No, no.
That's old-school, Pops.
You need to keep your pimp hand strong.
So, Bradley....
Yo, why you keep calling me that?
Well, that's your name, isn't it?
It's my slave name, all right?
I told you like times!
Okay.
B-Rad.
What's up?
What are your goals, B-Rad?
What do you want out of life?
To be the biggest rapper there ever was.
You see, doc, I got something to say...
and I need the world to hear it.
I'm a "lyrisologist." I can rap about anything.
See?
I'm the shiznit!
I'll buy y'all cars.
I see.
When did you first start feeling like you were this...
shiznit?
Dang, way back in the day.
I had these beats in my head since I was a little shorty.
From then on in, it was hip-hop / .
As I was growing up, my parents and me couldn 't communicate.
They were always on different channels.
Finish those vegetables, Bradley.
They smell good.
You won 't be excused until you do.
Forget y'all!
That's it, mister-- What I 'm sensing, Brad...
is that...
your parents weren 't always there for you.
No.
That's ridiculous.
What about your bar mitzvah?
What's the theme of your bar mitzvah?
Star Wars?
Baseball?
Superheroes?
It's O.P.P., bitch!
What?
Bess.
I think you want to share.
B-Rad, you're a wonderful son.
It's just that....
Well....
Bess, let's not beat around the bush.
Brad...
your behavior has become an embarrassment to the family.
Don't be hating.
And I can't have you on the campaign anymore.
What?
That's how it is?
You done it now!
Y'all opened up big a can of tough love!
What can we do, doctor?
I don't know.
This is the most advanced case of "gangsta-phrenia" I've ever seen.
Three colors for our country.
Where's the red?
Bill!
Hey, Bill.
How'd it go with Dr Feldman?
Great.
If he sees Brad five times a week for the next three or four years...
we should see some real improvement.
But, sir, the election is eight weeks away.
Right, good point.
It's okay.
We've been brainstorming some different approaches...
...and we might have something solid.
Well, I'm all ears.
Go!
Okay, sir.
Brad acts ghetto, right?
But he's never been east of Beverly Hills.
But what if we give him a little dose of reality?
Let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto.
You mean have Brad actually go there?
Exactly.
Well, now, that sounds dangerous.
No!
Perfectly safe.
How's it work?
We hire actors to play gangstas.
Right.
They will carjack Brad and take him on a tour around the 'hood.
Give him a taste of what the thug life is really like.
lt might just scare the black out of him.
Excuse me?
Hey, don't you have something to do?
Enough of the P.C.
Fact is, unless we do something now, Brad is going to cost us this election.
Who would play the gangsters?
Remember the anti-crime spot we shot a month ago?
We've got that queued up.
Yes, we do.
Over here, please.
For too long, street violence has torn Californians apart.
Bill Gluckman wants to put our divisions behind us.
Hey, instead of thinking about what set you're from...
or what crew you 're rolling with...
why don 't you both be brothers?
What do you say?
Your hair looks great.
I ain't never thought of it like that.
Shake hands.
You see?
California is my family.
If we all work together as a family, there's no telling how high we can go.
See, that's beautiful.
These are the guys we're talking about.
All right, let me get this straight.
You want us to scare this kid into acting like a little white boy again?
If you don't think you can handle it-- Of course we can handle it.
I'm from Juilliard, for chrissake.
I'm from the Pasadena Playhouse.
Good.
I have some background information on our dear boy Brad.
Materials.
Mali-bootay?
Yes, he considers himself a rapper of sorts.
Frigging A.
The story is your basic kidnapping.
By kidnapping, you mean we hold him for ransom?
Good question.
Right.
Now, when you see him start to get ghetto and do his whole black thing-Yes, that.
I want it to piss you off.
Tour him around the 'hood, around the ghetto, if you will...
...and show him what it's really like.
ln the ghetto?
Pays grand apiece, son.
We're in.
Good.
Now, on the flip side....
Flip it.
If you two screw up and a single hair is touched on Brad's overprivileged head...
I will see to it personally that you two do some serious time.
Are we clear?
Oh, we are Cristal.
I like that.
Mr Gibbons.
What about the money?
We have up front...
and when you return him to us...
white.
As the driven snow.
Pleasure doing business, gentlemen.
Let me get that for you, sir.
I'll call you.
Or better yet, I'll holler.
We'll holler back!
Holler back, player.
Thank you.
All right.
Congratulations, buddy!
We just booked another gig!
Not so fast, this is dangerous stuff.
This is the ghetto.
We could get shot!
Come on, man.
We can handle ourselves.
Right?
This will be the ultimate acting challenge.
You know what really chaps my ass?
What?
After all of our years of training and studying...
they continue to give us parts that are gangbangers.
Just once I'd like to play someone who speaks with proper grammar...
and doesn't wear those Timberlands with the laces undone, it's so sloppy.
It beats getting dunked on by Bill Gluckman!
Do we even know anybody that lives in the ghetto?
My cousin.
Shondra.
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
I got better things to do with my time.
Like what?
Work at Wiener On A Bun?
Come on!
Really, you're always talking about improving yourself.
Here's your chance!
I am improving myself, fool!
I broke up with no-good, gangbanging Tec, I'm going to beauty school...
and then I'm gonna hook up my own salon.
How about hooking a brother up with a Pepsi and fries?
Shut up, stupid.
PJ.
What?
P J You need to do this.
You need to walk away from this minimum-wage crap...
take these earnings and start that beauty parlor.
What you paying?
Business.
We're in business.
A grand.
We're paying a grand.
Make it trey and we on.
Three thousand dollars?!
Or you can kiss my ass.
Deal.
Hey, hey.
Deal.
Now what about those fries?
Thank you.
Hey, Gladys?
Yeah, baby?
You ever feel like you don't belong?
All the time.
Most folk only feel comfortable around folk that's the same as them.
They get around folk that's different...
get all scared and angry, want to keep them down.
What do you do about it?
Nothing to do but keep it real and be proud of who you are.
Gladys?
When they gonna leave our people alone?
I don't know, baby.
I just don't know.
Now eat your greens before they get cold.
"Whack: Weak, of poor quality.
Bad.
Whack." Your alma mater is whack.
"Dis: To disrespect, to embarrass." -Bring it on, baby.
We are strapped now, brother!
Set these bad boys down.
This is exactly what we ordered?
Yeah, man.
They got the Glocks, the Tecs, the Uzis.
Freeze, sucker!
That's convincing, brother!
Look, they're fake.
What the hell is that?
What's going on with your hair?
Yeah, check it out, man, my hair.
Shondra just did it for me.
Yeah, I see that.
You hate it.
No, I don't hate it.
I thought my character was gonna have the cornrows.
That's all.
Okay, I see what it is.
You're just jealous because you didn't think of it first.
Frigging A, I'm not jealous, all right.
I'm an actor and I would've....
You're frigging whack...
and don't dis me!
Got the gangster gear, my dog.
Okay, cool.
What is so funny?
The wig!
I didn't know it was Halloween!
While you're out, could you bring me back some candy?
Whatever, dude!
Give me your ride, punk, or I will dust your ass.
Nope.
Not convincing.
Damn it!
Find your core character, Sean.
You are an oppressed black man...
...from the ghetto.
I'm having trouble finding this one.
Think Tupac.
All right.
Let me try it again.
I see it.
Action!
Give me your ride, punk, or I will dust your ass!
Add a "bitch" and I think you got it!
Give me your ride, punk, or I will dust your ass, bitch!
Bitch!
Click it!
Bitch!
Turn around and do it again!
Bitch!
Domi-ho's!
Boo-yah!

Shut up.
You all right in here?
Oh, yeah.
I just been kidnapped, carjacked and hands tied behind my back.
But other than that, it's all good.
Look, I'm sorry about all that.
That wasn't really my idea.
I thought you liked me.
I do!
Then how come you set me up?
I had to.
They threatened to kill me if I didn't play along.
For real?
Yeah.
They straight-up killers out there!
For real?
Let me school you on something.
Help us both stay alive.
Okay.
The one thing they hate...
more than anything that really makes them crazy...
...is posers.
Me too, girl.
I feel you.
I'm talking about you.
Me?
I ain't a poser.
Shoot.
I got a Ph.D., a Poser-Hater Degree.
Come on, quit fronting.
I ain't fronting.
This is my sizzal.
For rizzal, my nizzal.
Stop it!
You stop it right now and you listen to me.
If you just be yourself, a nice little white boy...
...I think I can convince them to let you go.
But I'm being myself!
I ams who I says I ams.
Damn!
Why won't anybody believe me?
Well?
Maybe you should show him your ass.
I thought that would have worked.
Weird.
All right, what's next?
How about number three?
Perfect.
We're gonna take it to an entirely different level.
I got it.
What?
I'm gonna walk in there and be crazy.
I'll be ghettofied, buckwild.
You tell me, "Stick to the plan, man.
Stick to the plan." Got it?
Wake up, snowflake!
Yeah!
We called your dad!
What did he say?
He said he'd think about it.
He don't want your ass home right now.
I can't say that I blame him.
Hell, no.
Not the knife, dog!
Now come on!
What you doing?
Teach this white girl a lesson!
Bloodbath, we said we would stick to the plan!
Bloodbath, stick with the plan.
Tree, the plan done changed!
Wannabe say he down.
I'm gonna show him just how un-down he is!
I gotta cut him!
No, you can't cut him!
I gotta.
You don't gotta.
We can't get our money!
I thought you said to cut him!
No-- -Okay, just the white meat.
Move!
Let me cut him!
Don't kill him though, Bloodbath!
All right, now, Malibu.
I want you to go up in there.
You go get me six s of O.E.
And a fifth of Henny.
Yeah.
Anything else, dog?
No, playa, I'm cool.
Right on.
Right on.
I'd like some Pringles.
This ain't no picnic, bitch!
I'm sorry.
Y'all got some ducats?
Because since you stole my-- Man!
You about to go up in there and give them Koreans your ends?
Hell, no!
You jack that shit, fool!
And if the Asiatic give you any static, hit the fool with this right here.
Look at the little busta.
Little busta.
Can't even swing a gat.
Shoot.
Talking about "he down." -But-- -You use that or I'm gonna use it on you!
Okay.
And if you try to get away?
I'm gonna let you taste a piece of my blue steel.
You feel me?
Okay.
All right.
Go on, get out!
Okay.
Go!
Hey, white boy.
"This ain't no picnic, bitch"?
Wow!
Thank you.
I loved the blue steel line.
Convincing.
I really can't believe that!
Those improv classes are paying off.
When you said, "This is no picnic, bitch," I screamed on the inside like one.
For real?
Yeah, I said: I'm thirsty, I gotta tell you.
And, boy, do I love Olde English.
It really helps quench my thirst.
Can I help you?
No, I'm gonna help myself to this O.E.
and anything else I want up in here, bitch!
Can I help you?
Y'all never been robbed?
Sure.
Last week was time.
But they were cool.
No gun to head, never scream.
You know, good people.
Cool.
So, dude, how much did you pay the guy?
What are you talking about?
When you set this thing up yesterday.
I thought you set it up.
You mean--?
Dude, the owner doesn't know this is fake?
$ .
.
Go in and save him!
He could get shot!
I'm not gonna go in there!
You go in there!
His frigging life is at stake!
My emergency stash!
I'm glad you got cash, because if you had tried to jack me, fool...
I was gonna have to lay you out with this!
And with this.
And with that.
Keep the change.
Do me this one favor.
You are the driver.
I am the shooter!
I'm scared of Koreans!
You-- Thank you.
Thank you very much!
Come again!
What I'm about to do right now, I know it sounds whack...
but it's just a joke, okay?
So please don't shoot me?
Yeah, that's right, fool!
Next time I'll bust a cap in your punk ass, bitch!
Yeah, you lucky I don't burn you down!
Hell, yeah!
Hell, yeah!
What the hell is wrong with you?
You actually did it?
Let's roll!
Hell, yeah!
He didn't do nothing!
He straight-up trick.
What's up with this?
If you jacked it, how come you got a receipt?
I stole that too.
What's on tap for tomorrow?
Well, we have the : with Greenpeace, then drinks later with the offshore oil lobby.
How's the Brad project going?
Smooth.
He's in South Central.
God, is he okay?
Oh, he's in excellent hands.
All right.
I'm sick of playing game with you, snowflake!
I'm gonna give you five seconds to be real or I'm gonna beat that ass to the curb!
What you mean be real?
You know what I mean.
Be white!
Five.
Don't do it, Bloodbath!
Four.
Don't do it, Bloodbath!
Three.
He gonna do it!
Two.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Okay, all right!
Okay, fellas, look, I'm really sorry, okay?
I don't mean to offend you, you know.
I don't mean to front or act like a thug.
I'm sorry.
You buying that?
I don't know.
I can't tell.
Me neither.
Let's give him the test.
How you doing, white boy?
You cool?
Great.
Fine.
Terrific popcorn.
Run, bitch, run!
He gonna kill you!
I ain't lying.
I ain't lying.
Sorry, y'all, but this is who I am.
I'm just a rapper, straight up.
Wigga, please!
No, for real.
I can rap about anything.
You think you got skills?
We gonna see about that.
Oh, hell, yeah.
Hey, man.
I had it up to here with you.
You better check yourself before you wreck yourself.
This ain't Malibu.
Represent.
Oh, yeah.
We gonna see what you represent now, fool.
We at the club!
Snoop, Dre, Cube, all them.
They came in through here.
Got something to prove to yourself?
Do it in there.
Get in there, fool!
Go on up in there!
Think this is gonna do it, dude.
Oh, we're about to get paid!
What's cracking?
Hey, dog.
Yeah, how you feeling now, Malibu?
Like I'm home.
Get your ass in there then, fool.
Go!
Come on.
Let me get through here, man.
Yo.
Man, I told you I didn't have-- What's happening?
Look, our homey-- You wanna get a young Dre next, man?
Hell, no.
You hear what he's saying?
Meet my boy, Ben Franklin.
What's his name?
B-Rad from Malibu, player.
B-Rad from Mal--?
You trying to get me shot?
Hey, you met Ben Franklin's twin brother?
Cutter, playa.
We're gonna bring him up.
Go back and play with each other.
Come back in five minutes.
Playa....
Y'all got some Will Smith back there?
Get jiggy with it!
Hey, miss.
Where you been?
Oh, Shondra!
Shondra!
I been busy, Tec.
You been getting busy?
None of your damn business.
Okay, okay, I'm cool.
I understand.
Just tell me who it is.
All you need to know is that it ain't your black ass.
See, this that shit.
Think you're better than me.
All you is is a chickenhead and that's all you ever gonna be.
Hey, girl.
What's up?
You all right?
I'm fine, but you the finest!
She the truth too, dude.
I'm telling you, once Mothra gets set up, boy....
once Mothra gets set up, boy....
You hitting this?
No.
Now let me go!
You hitting this?
Hey, dude, didn't your mama ever tell you how to treat a lady?
That's not nice.
Oh, so you know my moms?
No, but she wouldn't appreciate you grabbing a woman like that.
What would your mom prefer?
You know, just talk to them and be nice to them.
Know what my mom would do?
My mom would tell you to mind your own damn business!
Don't!
Don't be hating.
Tec, don't!
Stop it!
Y'all gonna be real sorry, the both of you.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Who was that?
Old history.
You know what?
Come on.
He strong.
Excuse me.
Where we going?
Just shut up.
Move, please?
You gotta get out of here.
You letting me go?
I'm not having your blood on my hands.
It's the red Honda by the door.
Just go.
All the way from Malibu, B-Rad.
Give it up for B-Rad.
Straight out of Malibu.
B-Rad, come on up.
B-Rad.
Go!
I can't.
Why?
Shondra...
...anybody can rap at the Malibu County Fair.
This is my chance, my one shot.
I gotta prove myself.
This is gonna be like an episode of Oz.
Yeah, excuse me.
Yeah, I'm just gonna go on stage, do my rhyme thing.
They kind of pack them in tight here.
Get up there.
Do your thing.
Yeah, get up there, fool!
Oh, hell, no!
No, hell, no.
Him?
No!
Hell, no.
Do you all have a locker?
Man, come on.
You a rapper?
Yeah, straight up.
I didn't know Dairy Queen had a rap label.
Hey, I may be white, but my rhymes is tight.
I'm down, y'all.
No, you ain't down, homey.
I ain't battling no bitch, homey, first of all.
I know you heard that!
Yo, Felli!
Can I serve this fool right quick?
Hey, man.
Serve him, dog.
Hey, y'all give it up for my man Hi-C.
Let's set it off.
What's it gonna be, Saltine?
Heads or tail?
Tiz-ziz-ails!
Tails.
I like tails, please.
What's it gonna be?
First or second?
Hey, ladies first.
No.
Y'all cut it out.
Serve him, Hi-C.
Man, check this out.
I got something for his ass.
Do this for me, let me hear-- Yeah, say: Y'all give it up for Hi-C!
Hi-C in the house!
Big Steel serving, baby, serving heavy his style.
Man, I ain't gonna battle this little punk.
Let's see what you got.
When I say, "Mali," you say, "'Bu." Mali-- Okay, feeling the love.
Here we go, dog!
One, two, three, four, flow!
I'm sorry.
It's Black History Month.
You out your rabbit-ass mind?
What is this?
Is this some sort of rap initiation?
This is not how they do it on American Idol.
Come on.
Don't be hating.
Yo, all y'all rappers out there!
My name is Brad Gluckman...
...and when I'm on the mic, you can really say I suck, man!
Look, y'all.
Y'all had y'all laugh.
Just chill out.
Yeah, because B-Rad G's about to get ill.
Yo, I ain't laughed that hard in a long, long time.
For real.
Hey, yo, player.
Your pops called, and you know what he said?
He ain't paying.
He just wants you to stay in the 'hood with the brothers.
You know, since you so down and all.
I guess we gonna have to smoke your punk ass.
What you think about that?
I don't care no more.
I got nothing to live for.
Go ahead, smoke me.
Dude.
You believe what they putting on-stage?
That's right.
You getting played, homey.
Straight out, dog.
Excuse me?
I said you getting played, dog.
Little white boy up there hitting your lady.
She digging it, loving what's going on.
You know what I was kind of thinking to myself?
Maybe I'd go next.
You want next?
Let a homeboy get some action, you know?
Hey, homes!
What's up?
Not here, Tec.
What you wanna do?
I wanna bag me a white boy, that's what I wanna do.
Hey, you okay?
You know, it's not as bad as it seems.
It's worse.
Everybody's right.
My rhymes is weak.
You just need a little work.
I should've run when you gave me the chance.
No, you were right.
I respect you for getting up there.
You got mad heart.
But you heard them laughing.
I ain't nothing but a busta.
They just don't understand you.
None of them know how hardcore it is up in Malibu.
Yeah?
Yeah.
With the traffic...
...and the sharks.
Y'all got sharks.
And when the public be all up on your private beach?
Right.
Right.
You just gotta stick with it and be yourself.
Don't let anybody tell you who you are.
You all right, B-Rad.
Shondra?
You know when I was saying earlier, in the car, about being a player and all?
I was just fooling.
I ain't never been with a real black girl before.
For real?
Well, except on the lnternet.
You the finest girl I ever seen in my whole life.
And I was wondering...
...since they're gonna ice me in the morning...
...could l, like, kind of, maybe...
...hopefully...
...kiss you?
You so pretty.
Thank you.
Oh, you real pretty!
Damn, fool!
I said kiss!
I offered you a snack, not the whole kitchen!
My bad!
My bad!
My bad.
Oh, hell, no!
Hell, no!
Get your ass up!
Get your big ass up!
Move!
All right, that's it.
This game is whack.
I want my money and then y'all can get out.
Hey, Shondra, but we're not done yet.
And you ain't never gonna be done.
Did it ever occur to you clowns this might be the way he really is?
No.
Whatever.
Look, I did what you asked.
I want my money.
You fail to realize that putting together this operation has been quite expensive.
Bling bling!
Excuse me?
I might not have all the money right now.
Are you playing me?
Y'all better get my money or I'm going in there and I'm gonna tell him what's up.
Hey, dog.
Down here, dog.
Stuart Little?
Negro, please.
That little white rat ain't got nothing on me.
Yo, I'm Ronnie Rizzat, represizzent.
Hey, Ronnie.
Why you down, dog?
I'm a failure.
No, it ain't like that, fool.
You need to stop listening to all them perpetrators and just be yourself.
For real?
For rizzeal.
Pound it.
Hold up.
You saying if I put my mind to it, I can be whatever I wanna be?
Damn straight.
That if I follow my dreams...
...I can achieve true happiness?
Word.
And if I work hard, I can be the biggest rapper there ever was?
Rapper?
Hell, no.
You stink.
Don't be hating.
I'd rather eat garbage than listen to your tired-ass rhymes.
Now look here, man.
I'm up out of here.
I gotta go see my lady.
She's a breeder rat at PetCo.
And please believe it.
It's all gonna work out for the best.
Oh, shiznit!
He totally bought it.
The carjack going into the kidnapping.
And we staged a beautiful liquor store robbery.
You should have been there.
Unfortunately...
...he still seems to be posing...
...so we've taken it upon ourselves to plan a drive-by shooting next.
Mr Gluckman will be very happy.
It's gonna take more money than we projected.
We were wondering if you could give us an advance-- No, no, no, no, no.
You'll get the rest of your money when Richie Cunningham walks through my door.
Right.
I do under-- -Good.
Mr Gibbons?
Hello?
Damn!
They been playing me all along!
I knew my rhymes was dope!
I knew the 'hood couldn't be this bad.
How could they do that?
How could she do that?
All right.
The damn fools wanna play?
Then let's play!
What the hell?!
What the hell are you doing?
Listen up!
B-Rad G's in the hizzy.
And things are gonna start changing around here for shizzy.
Do something!
You better shut your mouth, fool!
Get back in that room before I beat your ass.
You feeling froggy?
Then leap.
Anybody else wanna step?
No.
What the hell got into you?
Shut up, ho!
Ho?!
Who you calling a ho, ho?
You, ho!
The same ho that gave up that weak-ass kiss five minutes ago in the bedroom.
Really?
Shondra.
I told you she liked white boys.
Who do you think you are?
I'm B-Rad G from 'Bu.
Represent.
What y'all didn't realize is, I was trying to put my mobbing days behind me.
But rolling with y'all done re-awoke my inner killer.
So let's start dropping bodies!
Don't stand there!
Come on, girl, help us!
You created that monster.
You deal with it!
Hey, where you going, man?
I need to take a drive.
Where you fixing to drive to?
I think today's a good day to die.
Why you talking crazy, man?
Just be cool.
Hey!
I might as well go out in a blaze of glory.
My daddy don't love me, my rhymes is played out...
...I ain't down enough for y'all.
No, you're down.
Isn't he down, PJ?
Tree, ain't he down?
Yeah, he down as they come, fool!
Oh, my God!
It's a jack!
Get out the car, white boy!
Oh, you that weak fuck from the club.
Get your behind out the car, man!
Got something for me?
Hell, yeah.
You ready to die?
Ain't that a "co-inky-dink." I was just talking to my two homeys about that.
Shut up and move.
Move him!
All right.
But y'all should change up your style because this jackings is getting tired.
Hey, yo, Bloodbath, if there's one scratch on my ride, I'm gonna eat your children!
Shotgun!
Yo, Deuce, shut him up.
Jesus.
Ball, what should we do with Bloodbath and his friend?
Nothing.
I said shotgun.
Know what shotgun means?
Shotgun means I ride in the front.
You better hope I don't piss in your trunk.
Shut up.
Allow me to clear this up for you, my dogs.
My name isn't Bloodbath...
...it's Sean James, and I'm just an actor-- -ls Shondra hitting that white boy?
I don't think anyone's hitting anybody.
She's just in on the scam we have going.
What you talking about, scams?
Hey, player, we were just hired to kidnap Bill Gluckman's son, man.
That's all we was doing.
ls that that dude running for governor?
You know him?
Hell, yeah.
Down with the bitches and ho's.
I'm voting for him.
You think we ignorant because we live in the 'hood?
I didn't say that.
Man, we would never say that, brother!
Silence!
Yo, we got Gluckman's son.
Gotta be worth more alive than dead.
What you think?
Gotta be.
Grab Fatback.
I got Milk Dud.
Let's roll.
I'm soft.
The polls say that since Brad has been out of the picture...
...we have gone up six points.
Yeah, but we're still dead in the urban demos.
Gays too.
We can't win without them.
Mr Gibbons?
Yeah.
I have a Sean on the phone for you, sir.
Check it out, homes.
Is that him or what?
Yeah, that's Tec from the ls, homes.
Call Cyco.
Tell him to bring it all down.
We're gonna have ourself a party tonight.
Mr Gibbons, we have a real serious problem here.
I told you no more money.
Yes, I realize you said that, but this is-- -We're in really big troub-- -Listen, fool.
Gluckman's boy's been kidnapped for real, along with your punk-ass friends.
Kidnapped?
If Mr Governor wants to see his punk bitch baby boy alive again...
...I want grand by tomorrow midnight.
How do I know this is real?
What, you think your actors is this good?
Say something!
Please help us.
I am...
...so...
...scared!
Please help us.
Well?
Okay.
I'm convinced.
Get my money.
Fine.
I can arrange that, but-- You got minutes.
Now what?
We wait.
What?!
They want grand or they'll kill him.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Oh, come on!
Oh, no!
Oh, my God.
We're going to jail.
Wait, slow down.
Don't panic.
lt was your idea!
That was idiotic!
Don't panic.
Just let me think this through here.
You're as guilty as any of us.
Now, we may just have a very interesting opportunity here.
Where are you going with this?
The negatives are obvious.
Yeah!
Bill drops out of the race, emotional distress.
I can handle Bill.
What are the positives?
Well, there are just so many.
No more Brad problem.
Right.
Right, I like that!
With a dead son, sympathy could spike us in the female and gay demos.
Wait, I've got the image!
Bill weeping...
...over Brad's open casket.
After grieving, he goes on the offensive.
His war on crime!
Drugs!
Gangs!
It's what's hot!
Oh, that's great!
It's just what we needed!
Get over there, man.
Hold me!
Who this?
No deal.
Say what?
Bill Gluckman does not deal with criminals.
That's it.
His punk ass is dead.
You do what you have to do.
We'll do what we have to do.
There you go.
That was cold.
Yo, take off the tape.
Goddamn, that hurts like a motherfick!
I'm gonna have to teach you all some manners!
Your daddy ain't paying.
Tell me something I don't know.
What?
You heard me, you half-stepping, moist-ass bitch!
Excuse me?
You gonna do it like that?
All right, then.
Bring it.
It's been brought.
Okay, then.
That gat's real, right?
So then do it.
Put crackerjack out his misery.
Come on, y'all.
I'll do it myself.
Pull the trigger!
Get him!
This fool is crazy!
I cannot deal with this shit.
Oh, damn!
Nice.
Yeah, this is good.
Get your ass down, fool!
Y'all take this seriously!
I love you, Sean.
I love you too.
Lay down some cover, fool!
We can't!
They too strapped!
"We can't!
they too strapped!" -What we gonna do?
"What we gonna do?
" Punks.
Give me them gats.
Y'all are serious crazy.
Y'all wanna play?
Then let's play.
Y'all know who you dealing with?
I'm Malibu's most wanted, y'all!
King Kong ain't got nothing on me!
Damn.
These special effects is the bomb.
Let's go!
Let's dip!
Let's go!
It's safe now, y'all.
Hey, yo, that was ill.
And y'all punk asses ain't do nothing.
All that buffness for no reason.
That's him.
Get over here.
Where you learn that from?
Grand Theft Auto .
Word?
Can I borrow that?
You got a PlayStation?
No, I got GameCast.
GameCast?
There's GameCube and Dreamcast.
Which you got?
I said I got GameCast, man.
Damn!
I can't afford it!
My bad.
I'm just trying to help you out.
I'm gonna holler at you.
My wigga.
Hey, what up, my nizzle?
What's up, baby?
How you doing, man?
I got something for you.
That's yours, B.
Oh, for real?
Yeah.
Yo, you shouldn't have.
Serious moment.
Bring it in, y'all.
Welcome to the Nines, baby.
Only way out now is in a box.
ln a box?
ln a box.
Oh, in a box.
Right.
Good evening, I'm Hal Fishman.
We open tonight with a Channel News exclusive.
A security camera captured incredible footage...
...of gang violence tonight as it flared on the streets of South Central.
This hardcore gangster, believed to be the notorious White Kong...
...ringleader of a South Central street gang...
...fired his weapons with wanton disregard for human life or personal property.
If you have any information on the whereabouts of this man...
...call our KTLA hotline at -SNITCH.
Oh, my God!
Yo, that is some hardcore shnizit.
Damn, Moch, what are we gonna do?
We're gonna bounce back to our respective cribs...
...jack our mom and dad's biggest gats, jet down to South Central and save his ass.
Word.
Word.
Hey, Bradley's been involved in a gang shooting.
What?
No, it couldn't be.
No.
His face is all over the news.
I think I'd know my own son.
All right, well, I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Get some sleep and let me take care of it.
Sleep?
He's shooting the hell out of South Central.
Let's go get him.
No!
Bill, you have a debate tomorrow in Sacramento.
The hell with the debate.
Cancel that and you can kiss this campaign goodbye.
Shove the debate up your ass.
I'm not gonna lose my son over this.
Listen, I understand you're upset...
...but for once in your life will you think outside the box?
For once?
This whole thing, this whole Brad thing with the gangs...
...we can spin it.
Make it into a positive.
Positive?
lf he's arrested or injured...
...we can spin it so you're the victim.
"Crime reaches everyone" kind of thing.
Are you trying to get votes out of this?
I'm trying to win and you don't seem to care!
I'm his father!
Since when?
Since right now.
And you're fired.
We need to brainstorm on how I get my job back.
Hello, this is OnStar.
I'm looking for a location of the license number D-SHlzNlT.
That vehicle is at the corner of McKinley and nd Street, sir.
What are you supposed to be?
Robo-bitch?
All right, Monster, what are you packing?
This.
What is that?
My pop's spear gat, from the yacht.
What is he hunting, Flipper?
Think you so bad.
What you got?
Never mind.
Come on, let's see it.
All right, chill.
Chill.
ls that a freaking musket?
Yeah, it's a freaking musket.
Shut up!
Shut up, you damn posers!
Hadji, how about you?
I couldn't get much, yo.
Just this.
Oh, my God.
Dang!
Where'd you get all that?
Christmas present from Uncle Ahmet.
Mercedes-Benz, may I help you?
Hell, yes, chickenhead!
I need a location on license plate D-SHlzNlT.
That car is on the corner of McKinley and nd Street.
Where's he going?
Are they making a sandwich?
He's the mayonnaise between the wheat bread.
Go, Brad!
Get some black ass!
Get some black ass.
Where's B-Rad at?
I haven't seen a thing.
I haven't seen him.
Shondra?
A little help, please?
Sit your monkey ass down.
Don't move.
What you know about this?
What you know about that?
You want some of this crotch?
Yeah, he does.
Get it, girl.
You know what?
You know, I just tested positive...
...for G-A-M-E.
All right, gangsta.
Come on, girl.
Let's do this.
Okay.
We gonna show you something.
Wait till you see what we're gonna do.
I ain't mad at nothing.
I wanna learn.
You wanna learn?
I like that.
I'm ready for the chocolate love.
Shondra?
Yeah, it's Shondra...
...but I guess I wasn't good enough for you.
What?
You had to get two more.
No, she didn't.
Yes, she did.
This no-good, deadbeat, weak-ass white boy won't take care of little Malik.
Malik?
Or Taquayzsha.
Taquayzsha?
Or Nahojay.
Naho-who?
Oh, no, now that's trifling.
Let's get out of here.
Thank you, girl.
No problem, ladies.
Okay, bye-bye.
Damn.
Why you throwing salt on my G-A-M-E?
I am saving your lily-white ass.
Now come on.
I ain't going nowhere.
I'm a l now.
Peep my tat.
Listen, fool-- -No, you listen.
I know what you done.
How this whole thing is fake.
The stickup, the kidnap, the whole nizzy.
Damn.
No, you damn.
Why you play me?
For the money.
Money?
What you need money for?
Look, fool, this may sound stupid to you, but not everybody has money.
And for the people who don't, money is important.
You're probably still flipping me and whatnot.
Damn it, B-Rad, this is real.
Tec and his crew are real.
Oh, really?
Well, then if Tec is real, then this gat must be real.
And if this gat is real, then the bullets in it have got to be real.
And seeing how my foot is real, this would really hurt.
See that?
I just shot my foot.
And it's real!
Oh, my God, this whole thing is real!
I just shot my foot.
I just shot my foot.
I just shot my foot.
Sit.
Stop hopping around, fool.
Goodness.
Oh, God.
Oh, Shondra, I'm dying!
This cap barely grazed you.
I can't live!
Lucky you such a weak-ass shot.
Then it's real.
This whole thing is real!
Stop moving.
Hey, who doing all that popping up-- -Oh, God.
Hey, what the hell?
Hey, what up, cuz?
Hey, Tec!
My road dog, yeah.
Just the man I want to see.
You know Shondra.
What's going on, Shondra?
Tec, I swear, it is not what it looks like.
Don't lie to me.
That was my line and it always was what it looked like.
What's going on with your boyfriend?
I'd love to kick it with you...
...and run this thizzang, but I got business back in Bu...
...something with Dre-Dre.
So if you don't mind-- I do mind!
Wait, Tec, let me explain.
Because I don't belong here.
What, you done forgot already, fool?
I done told you.
There's only one way out of the ls.
And your E-ticket's in this here chamber.
There it is.
Did you see how committed he was?
That's the rage I was talking about.
Tec, please don't be hating.
I won't let you do it, Tec.
Fine.
Then I'll just do the both of you, then.
Damn, fool!
You just hit my house!
Brad?
Pops?
It's Mr Gluckman.
Brad, you okay?
Not really.
And unless you seriously strapped...
...you about to not really be okay too.
Hi.
Bill Gluckman, running for governor.
We know who you are, fool.
This dude thinks we ignorant just because we live down here.
You better recognize.
Well, I recognize.
You know, I recognize that street violence is tearing Californians apart.
And, fellas, California is my family.
Oh, and here's a thought.
Instead of thinking of ourselves as what set we're from, what crew you're rolling with...
...why can't we just be brothers?
What do you say?
I guess I never thought of it like that before.
You see that?
Please.
What do we say, brothers?
Get your ass out of here.
Don't anybody know where the goddamn driveway is?!
Hadji?
Y'all better step, or I'm gonna have to waste y'all.
Yeah, drop your gats!
No, drop your gats!
Hold up, y'all!
Before anybody ices anybody, I got something to say.
You really weren't gonna pay my ransom?
Oh, I didn't know anything about that.
You gotta believe me.
That was not part of the plan.
What was the plan?
Send me down here to scare me white?
I know, it was stupid.
I tried everything, I didn't know how to deal with you.
That's because you don't know me...
...and you never cared to find out.
Listen, I made a lot of mistakes.
I know that.
I'm not proud of myself.
I wasn't there for you.
I can't change that, but I always loved you.
And I still do.
And if you say that this is who you really are, I believe you.
And I accept you.
And from here on in...
...I promise to be a real father to you.
Talk is cheap.
Prove it.
Well, I'm here, ain't l?
All right, Pops.
We cool.
Much love.
I wish I could talk to my pops like that.
No doubt.
I'm gonna call that nigga right now.
Would you get your emotional gangsta ass together?
We got business to handle.
Let's smoke these fools!
Tec, before we all smoke each other, can I say one little more thing?
What you got to say this time?
Kick it freestyle, Moch.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop it!
You say one more line and I'm gonna have to smoke myself!
All right.
But all these gats got to go.
I'm serious, Tec.
Ain't no more gats.
B-Rad's right.
All this hating is whack.
Run!
No, listen to me.
You really not listening to me.
If this ain't rebuilt by the time Moms get back...
...it's on you.
You gonna get the punishment.
You gonna laugh at me.
You gonna play me?!
You know who you playing?
I have two witnesses who were at the scene of the explosion.
Can you tell us what happened?
Oh, yeah, it was crazy, yo.
All these crazy fools came over strapped with they s.
I was just, like, telling the brothers, " Let's talk about this.
Let's talk this out.
Can't we all just get along?
Let's find our common ground." I was trying to keep the peace.
Really, the explosion was just a metaphor.
A metaphor for anger within our hearts.
Because the white man-- -Okay, thank you, Bloodbath and Tree.
All this mayhem is rumored to have been caused...
...by the mysterious White Kong, who is still at large.
This is Soon-Yee Baxter Hernandez reporting from South Central.
Sorry, sir.
Damn.
Are you all right?
You mean, besides the fact that I just been harpooned?
Yeah.
No.
I'm confused.
About what?
I don't know what was real and what wasn't.
Well, I definitely could use a little bit more of that reality.
What's up?
I thought the kitchen was open for business.
It is open, but you don't put your hands in a sista's hair.
Damn, fool.
My bad.
Here you go, boo.
All right, here we go.
Shondra's Salon is now officially open for business.
The chickens be out the coop.
Enjoy, ladies.
Damn.
She got in a fight with a hair dryer.
And the hair dryer won.
Hold up, girl.
I just wanna thank you.
You the only person that accepted me for who I really am.
I appreciate that.
You also kidnapped me, carjacked me and tried to scare me white.
I'm gonna let that one go.
Come here, boo.
Come on.
My own little White Kong.
That's right, White Kong.
It's official: Bill Gluckman is California 's next governor.
Let's go live to the big celebration.
Here he is, right here, y'all.
The man of the hour!
Bill Gluckman, y'all!
Go Gluck yourself!
Great.
We're gonna take it to a whole new level.
He became Black Superhero.
Hello.
What the fuck was that?
Yeah, you got something to represent?
You got something for your-- Yeah, you got something to prove to yourself?
Come on, Taye.
Don't laugh, motherfucker!
Ain't he down?
Yeah, Bloodbath.
You down, fool.
You down, down fool.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
You that weak fuck from the club!
You think I'm playing with you?
Yeah, you playing.
Open the door!
Hey, yo, dog, you know I'd love to stick it with you....
Hey, yo, dog, I'd love to kick it with you....
You think I'm cute?
Look at me, man.

Hello, we'd like you to have this flower from the religious consciousness church, would you care to make a donation?
No, thank you anyway.
The red zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only, there is no stopping in the white zone.
NO! The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading and there is no stopping in the red zone.
The red zone has always been for loading and unloading there is never stopping in a white zone.
Don't tell me which zone is for stopping and which zone is for loading.
Listen Betty, don't start up with your white zone shit again!
Hello, we'd like you to have this flower from the religious consciousness church, would you like to make a donation?
No thanks, we gave at the office. AT SECURITY

Would you put all of your metal objects into this dish please
There's just no stopping in a white zone.
Oh really, Vernon, why pretend, we both know perfectly well what it is you're talking about. You want me to have an abortion.
Its really the only sensible thing to do. If its done properly, therapeutically, there's no danger involved.
Taxi!
I'll be back in a minute.
Hello sir, we'd like you to have this flower on behalf of the church of Religious consciousness, would you caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarr...
Hey, Larry, where's the forklift?
Forklift? Its over there by the baggage loader.
LOOK OUT!!!! ARGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!! .
Elaine!!!!!
Ted!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to to talk to you.
I just don't want to go over it anymore.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but... It'll be different. Like it was in the beginning. If you'll just be patient I can work things out.
I have been patient and I tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Don't you feel anything for me at all anymore?
It takes so many things to make love last. But, most of all, it takes respect, and I can't live with the man I don't respect.
What a PISSER!
Captain Oever, white courtesy phone. Captain Cla rence Oever, white courtesy phone. OEVER PICKS UP A RED PHONE.
NO! THE WHITE PHONE.
Oh! This is Captain Oever!
One moment for your call from the Mayo Clinic.
Captain Oever, white courtesy phone. Captain Clarence Oever, white courtesy phone.
I'VE GOT IT!
Thank you.
Go ahead with your call.
Uh, this is Doctor Brody at the Mayo Clinic. There's a passenger on your Chicago flight 209er, a little girl named Lisa Davis, en route to Minneapolis. She's scheduled for a heart transplant, we'd like you to tell her mother we found a donor an hour ago. We have the heart here, ready for surgery. . . We must have the recipient on the operating table within 6 hours. I want you to make sure she's kept in a reclined position and that a continuous watch is kept on her IV. Also, its very important that she remain calm. . .
EXCUSE ME, This is the operator Captain Oever, I have an emergency call on line 5 from a Mr. Hamm.
Alright, Give me Hamm on 5, hold the Mayo.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night, we'll... have dinner. We'll talk things over.
I won't be back, I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, I promise, I can change.
Then why didn't you take the job that Louis Neds offered you at Boeing?
You know I haven't been able to get near a plane since since the war. Even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
You're war record ??? You're the only one keeping that alive, for everyone else, its ancient history.
You expect me to believe that?
Its the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Elaine, if you just give me one more . . .
Its too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Excuse me, we'd like you to have this flower from the Church of Religious Conscious. . .PUNCH . . . EWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi! Well, good evening. Oh, there you go. You just follow all the way back. Hello.
Any word on that storm lifting over Salt Lake Clarence?
No not likely, Victor. I just reviewed the area report for 1600 hours through 2400.
Uh, huh ...
There's a front stalled over the Dakotas, backed all the way to Utah.
Yeah, well, if she decides to push over to the great lakes, it could get plenty slippery.
Uh, huh.
What about the southern route, around Tulsa?
I double checked the terminal forecast and winds aloft and I had cloudy ceilings all the way.
Where do they top out?
Well . . . there's some light scattered cover to 20,000 icing around 15. . .
Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..
Boy looks like the original plan ought to be the best bet.
Denver it is.
Sorry Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything is sopped in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Oh, Hi Roger! Glad to have you aboard! Victor, this is Roger Murdock, Victor Basta.
How do you do Roger?
Nice to meet you!
Roger, I was telling Victor that I reviewed the area report for 1600 hours through 2400 there'sa front stalled over the Dakotas. . .
There you go, thank you.
Can you tell me if Elaine Dickenson is on this flight?
Well, the whole flight crew has boarded. Let me see. Oh yes, she is on board.
I'd like one ticket to Chicago. No baggage.

NO, I've been nervous lots of times.
Hi, we'll be taking off real soon. SO I'd better fasten you in tight.
Thank you. Oh, mother this is so exciting.
I know, but you must get some rest.
That's good advice. You relax and I'll be back right after we take off.

Oh, I'm gonna miss you too. Promise you'll write??

Oh, I haven't flown for a long time.
Good evening ladies and gentleman, this is Captain Oever speaking. Well, be cruising at 36,000 feet this evening. Our arrival time in Chicago will be
pm central time. The temperature there is currently 62 degrees with a 20% chance of precipitation. Meanwhile, relax and enjoy your flight.
Would you like something to read?
Do you have anything light?
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh... how about this leaflet, famous Jewish sports legends?
Yes, thank you.
Teeeeeeeeeeeed!?! What are you doing here?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you!
Y-Y-Yo-You shouldn't have come, I don't have time now!
Stewardess . . .
Excuse me!
No wonder you're upset! She's lovely! And a darling figure. Supple pouting breasts. . . firm thighs . . . its a shame you two don't get along.
Yes, I know, things used to be different. I remember when we first met. It was during the war. I was in the Air Force stationed in Drambui, off the Barbary coast. I used to hang out at the Magumba bar. It was a rough place, the seediest dive on the wharf. Populated with every reject and cut-throat from Bombay to Calcutta. Its worse than Detroit. The mood in the place was downright ugly. You wouldn't walk in there unless you knew how to use your fists. You could count on a fight breaking out almost every night.     We laughed, we talked, we danced I never wanted it to end. I guess I still don't. But, enough about me, I hope this hasn't been boring for you. Its just that whenever I talk about Elaine, I get so carried away, I loose all track of time.
Would you like to order dinner now?
Yes, Joey will have the steak and my wife and I will have the fish.
When can I see the cockpit dad?
Joey, I think the pilots are probably too busy flying the plane for that.
Awww, geee whiz!!!!!!!!!!
I'll tell you what Joey, I'll talk to the Captain and see what I can arrange.
Gee, that'd be swell!
Would you gentleman care to order your dinners?
Bet babe, slide a piece a da porter, drink si' run th' java.
I WOULD LIKE THE STEAK PLEASE.
Lookie here, I can dig grease and butter on some draggin' fruit garden.
I'LL HAVE THE FISH.
Excuse me, I happened to be passing and I thought you might like some coffee.
Oh, that's very nice of you. Thank you. Oh, won't you sit down?
Oh thank you. Cream?
No thank you, I take it black . . . . . . like my men.
Well, you see . . .
Oh TED! I never knew I could be so happy. These few months have been just wonderful. Tomorrow, why don't we drive up the coast to that little seafood place and . . . what's the matter???
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow, we're bombing the storage depots at Daiquiri at
hours. We're coming in from the North, below their radar.
When will you be back?
I can't tell you that? It's classified.
Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I love you Elaine.
I love you!
Flight 2-0-9er, this is Denver flight control. You are approaching some rough weather. Please climb to 42,000 feet.
Roger, Denver.
We have a visitor. . .
Hello.
Hi!
This is Captain Oever, Mr Murdock and Mr Basta. This is Joey Hammond. . .
Well hi Joey.
Come on up here, you can see better.
We have something here for our special visitors  , would you like to have it?
Thank youuuuuuu! Thanks alot!
Sure. You ever been in a cockpit before?
No sir, I've never been up in a plane before.
You ever . . . seen a grown man naked ?
Do you want me to check the weather Clarence?
No, why don't you take care of it. Joey, did ya ever hang around a gymnasium?
We'd better get back now Joey!
Noooooooo, Joey can stay here for a while if he'd like.
Could I?
Okay, if you don't get in the way.
Flight 2-0-9er to Denver radio, climbing to cruise at 42,000. Will report again over Lincoln. Over and out.
Wait a minute! I know you. You're Kareem Abdul-Jabar. You played basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers.
I'm sorry son, but you must have me confused with some- one else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
You are Kareem! I've seen you play. My dad's got season tickets.
I think you should go back to your seat now Joey. Right Clarence?
Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, he's not bothering anyone, let him stay here.
But just remember, my name is ROGER MURDOCK. I'm an airline pilot.
I think you're the greatest, but my dad says you don't work hard enough on defence. And he says that lots of times, you don't even run down court. And that you don't really try . . . except during the playoffs.
The hell I don't!! LISTEN KID! I've been hearing that crap ever since I was at UCLA. I'm out there busting my buns every night. Tell your old man to drag Walton and Denier up and down the court for 48 minutes.
Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. like it was in the beginning, remember?
I remember everything. All I have are memories. Mostly, I remember the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me and... how I used to sit on your face and wiggle and...afterwards how we'd watch 'til the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like . . . like . . . each new day was made only for us.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be Elaine.
But it won't be . . . not as long as you insist on living in the past.
You're too low Ted . . . YOU'RE TOO LOW!
Okay Robert, slip em down, this won't hurt much . .
You got a telegram from headquarters today.
HEADQUARTERS?!? What is it?
Well, its a big building where generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened in that raid. Isn't that good news?
Is it? Because of my mistake 6 men didn't return from that raid.
7, Lieutenant Zip died this morning. . .   The Doctor says you'll be out in a week, isn't that wonderful?
Wish I could say the same for George Zip.
Be patient Ted, nobody expects you to get over this immediately.
Hey Striker, How bout a break, I'm getting tired.
Yeah, alright. Take 5.
I have found a wonderful apartment for us. It has a brick fireplace and a cute little bedroom with mirrors on the ceiling and . . .
Red leader, Red Leader . . . I'm goin' down
Captain Jeleen. He thinks he's a pilot still fighting the war.
I've found the tunnel Johnson!! Its this way $25 for a cigarette is too much!
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
What's his problem?
Its Lt. Herwitz. Severe shell shock. Thinks he's Ethel Merman.
You'lllllll be swell... You'll be great... Gonna have the whole world on a plate. Startin' here. Startin' now. Honey, everything's coming up rosseehhhhhhhhsss. faints )
War is hell.
Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
No, no thank you.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
I will, but Jim won't.
I think I will have another cup of coffee.
Jim never has a second cup at home.
Excuse me sister . . .
Yeahhhs?
There's little girl on board up front who's ill and ..
Oh, yes. I saw, poor child.
Could I borrow your guitar . . . I think maybe I could cheer her up.
Of course.
Ohhhh.... thank you.
Hi!
Hi!
Do you mind if I talk to your daughter?
No I think that'd be nice.
Hi, I'm Randy.
I'm Lisa . . . YOU HAVE A GUITAAAAR!
Uh, huh! I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
I'd love too!
Okay. Let's see, uh... this is one of my favorites! I've traveled the banks of the river of Jordan To find where it flows to the sea I looked in the eyes of the cold and the hungry And I saw that I was looking at meeeeeee. And I wanted to know if life had a purpose And what it all means in the end In the silence I listened to voices inside me And they told me again and again. There is only one river   There is only one sea And it flows through you And it flows through me   There is only one people We are one in the same   We are all one spirit One naaaaaaaaaaaammmme. We are the father We are one. We are one. We are one.
Little late tonight. We've been waiting for you.
Who wants to be first?
Go ahead Clarence, I got 'er.
How's the weather?
Not so good. We've got some heavy stuff ahead of us. It might get rough again unless we can climb on top.
Yeah, after the war, I just wanted to get as far away from things as possible. Elaine and I joined the Peace Corps. We were assigned to an isolated
the Malumbos.   They'd never seen Americans before.
It was really a challenge during the year introducing them to our western culture. At first they didn't know what to think of us, but soon we gained their trust.
It will help you better prepare and store foods for the up and coming Monsoon months. Also, Supperware products are ideal for storing leftovers to help stretch your food dollar. This 2 quart Sealz-em Right container will keep hot dog buns fresh for days.
You must understand, these people had been completely isolated from civilization. No one had ever outlined a physical fitness program for them and they had no athletic equipment. I started them on simple calisthenics and slowly worked them up to rudimentary game skills. And finally, advanced competitive theory. I was patient with them and they were eager to learn. they seemed to enjoy themselves. It was probably due to the advanced American techniques that we were able to bridge the generations of isolation communicate so successfully with Mulambos. I think they're finally getting the hang of it when we re-enlist, I'll teach them baseball.
Ted, I don't want to stay here, its time for us to go back home to the plans we made before the war.
Alot of people made plans before the war . . . like George Zip. It was at that moment that I first realized Elaine had doubts about our relationship. And that as much as anything else led to my drinking problem   We did come back to the states, I tried a number of jobs . . . well, I could go on for hours, but I would probably start to bore you.   I really couldn't blame Elaine   she wanted a career.
Uhhhhhhhh...... I can't stand it. Ohhhhhhh.
Yes?
Oh... its my stomach. I haven't felt this aweful since we saw that Ronald Reagan film. uhh.
I'll see if I can find some Dramamine.   Captain, one of the woman passengers is very sick.
Airsick?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Find out if there's a doctor on board as quietly as you can. . . Joey . . . have you ever been in a, a Turkish prison?
Ohhhhhhhhhh, I shouldn't have had that second cup of coffee.
Jim never vomits at home.
I'm sorry I had to wake you, I'm just looking for a doctor, there's nothing to worry about.
Stewardess, I think the man sitting next to me is a Doctor.
Sir, excuse me sir, I am sorry I have to wake you, sir, are you a doctor?
That's right.
We have some passengers that are very sick, could you come take a look at them?
Yes, of course. . . Let me see your tongue.   I'll be back in a minute. You'd better tell the Captain we've got to land as soon as possible, we've got to get them to the hospital. . .
A hospital . . what is it?
Its a big building with patients, but that's not important right now. Tell the captain I must speak to him.
Certainly.
Victor, we're running into some heavy weather . . . can you Roger! Take OVER!
Captain, how soon can you land?
I can't tell.
You can tell me, I'm a doctor.
NO, I mean I'm just not sure.
Well, can't you take a guess?
Well, not for another 2 hours.
You can't take a guess for another 2 hours?
No, no, no. I mean we can't land for another 2 hours fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to get through to Chicago.
What is it doctor?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Anita Bryant concert. What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice, steak or fish.
Yes, yes, I remember, I had lasagna. What did he have?
Fish . . .
Doctor, there are 2 more sick people and the rest of the passengers are worried.
I'll go take care of the passengers. Find out what the two sick people had for dinner.
This is Captain Oever speaking, been a little bumpy up here, but we'll be past it in a couple minutes. A few points of interest we are now flying over Hoover damn and a little later on, we'll pass just to the south of the Grand Canyon. Meanwhile, relax and enjoy your flight, okay?
THIS IS FLIGHT 2-0-9er. . . We're in trouble, we've got to have all traffic below us cleared. I want a priority approach and landing in Chicago.
Stewardess, my husband is very sick can you do something please?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing, do you know what he had for dinner?
Yes, of course, we both had fish. Why?
Oh, its nothing to be alarmed about. We'll be back to you very quickly.
Dr Rumack, Mr Hammond ate fish, and Randy said there five more cases and they all had fish too.
And the Co-Pilot had fish, what did the navigator have?
He had fish.
Alright, now we know what we're up against. Every passenger on this flight who had fish for dinner will become violently ill in the next half hour
Just how serious is it Doctor?
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever and dryness of the throat. When the virus penetrates the red blood cells, the victim becomes dizzy begins to experience an itchy rash, then the poison goes to work on the central nervous system, severe muscle spasms followed by the inevitable grueling. At this point, the entire digestive system collapses accompanied by uncontrollable flatulence Until finally, the poor bastard is reduced to a quivering wasted piece of jelly.
Au--to--ma-tic pi-lot.
Automatic pilot, automatic pilot, there it is . . .
I'll go back to the passengers.
Come in 2-0-9er, this is Chicago. Flight 2-0-9er, come in.
This is Elaine Dickenson, I'm the stewardess, Captain Oever has passed out on the floor and the co-pilot and navigator too. We're in terrible trouble, over.
Roger, Elaine, Roger. I read you. This is Steve McCrosky at Chicago air control, Back to you in a minute Hold all takeoffs, I don't want another plane in the air. When the 508 reports, bring it straight in. Put out a general bulletin to suspend meal service on flights out of Los Angeles. Tell all dispatchers to remain at their posts, its gonna be long night. How bout some coffee Johnny?
NO THANKS!
I want the weather on every landing field this side of the line, no matter what the size. Do you understand? Anyplace, anyplace where there's a chance to land that plane. Stan, go up stairs to the tower and get a runway diagram. Terry, check down the field for emergency equipment.
Chief we got fog right down to the deck, every place east of the Rockies. There's no possible place to land, they'll have to come through to Chicago.
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking. I want the best available man on this, a man who knows that plane inside and out and won't crack under pressure.
How 'bout Mr Rogers?
Get me REX KRAMER! Elaine, right next to the throttle is the air speed gauge. What speed does it indicate?
520 miles per hour.
Good now, check your altitude. That's the dial just below and to the right of the air speed indicator.
35,000 feet. NO wait, 34,000 feet . . . NO WAIT, its dropping. Its dropping fast, why's it doing that? Oh my god, the automatic pilot, its deflating.
Don't panic, on the belt line of the automatic pilot there's a tube, now that is the manual inflation nozzle. Take it out and blow on it.
What the hell's going on up there?
Elaine?
Yes, Doctor.
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face a few unpleasant facts?
NO.
Alright, unless I get those people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone on board who can land this plane?
Well, no, no one I know of.
I think you ought to know what are chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on one
finding someone on board who can not only fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Ladies and gentleman, this is your stewardess speaking We regret any inconvenience the sudden cabin movement might have caused this is due to periodic airpockets we encountered. There's no reason to be alarmed and we hope you enjoy the rest of your flight. By the way, is there anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane?
Hello, I am Paul Puree from the airline, I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Oh, yes come in Paul, Rex will be right out.
Ruff, Ruff
Shep, sit. So, I understand you all have a real emergency down there.
Yes, something like that, but as I said, they didn't have time to tell me very much. Ahhhh.
Shep, no. I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Well, the airline business does have its moments   but after a while you get used to it.
Shep! Come. He gets so excited when new people are here. Are you a pilot yourself?
NO, I am in a training program. . .
Its unbelievable, just unbelievable, you know how many times I've warned them about food inspection.
You'd think after all these years someone would listen to you
Airport management, the FAA and the airlines. They're all cheats and liars. Alright, lets get outta here.
I'm sorry to bother you, I was just looking for someone with flying experience.
When they built those roads they had no thought of drainage in mind, so we had to take a special jeep up to the main road. In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep since just the day before the only one we had broke down, had a bad axle.
Excuse me sir, there's been a little problem in the cockpit . . .
The cockpit . . . what is it?
Its the little room in the front of the plane where the pilots sit, but that's not important now. You see the first officer is ill and the Captain need someone to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was years ago, I wouldn't know anything about it.
Won't you go up, please?
The stewardess said . . . BOTH PILOTS????????
Can fly this plane?
Surely you can't be serious?
I am serious, and don't call me Shirley!
Doctor, I've checked everyone. Mr. Striker is the only one.
What flying experience have you had?
I flew single engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. Its an entirely different kind of flying, altogether. All
Its a entirely different kind of flying.
Besides, I haven't touched any kind of plane in six years.
Mr. Striker, I know nothing about flying, but there's one thing I do
You're the only one on this plane who can possibly fly it, you're the only chance we've got.
NO, that's right, that's what I said . . . tell them all to acknowledge and stand-by. Get me every piece of emergency equipment you can reach. Alert rescue units every mile of the way, from here to the rockies.
Chief . . .
We'll need a pre-landing flight check, tell 'em I want it in the dispatch office and tell 'em I want it here fast.
Its your wife.
I want the kids in bed by nine, the dog fed, the yard watered and the gate locked. And get a note to the milkman NO MORE CHEESE! CLICK! Where the hell's Kramer?
No, we can't do that, the risk of a flame out is too great, leave 'em at 24,000 . . . no, feet. One of the passengers is gonna land that plane.
Is that possible?
Possible, its a 100-1 shot.
I know this guy.
You do?
Asssss-hole!
Who is it?
Name is Ted Striker, I flew with him during the war, it won't make my job any easier tonight. Ted Striker was a crack flight leader, up to a point. He was one of those men who, lets say, felt to much inside, maybe you know the kind. Went all to pieces on one particular mission, lets just hope that doesn't happen tonight.
Lets see. Altitude, 24,000 feet... level flight, speed 520 knots. Course, 0-9er-0, trim, mixture, wash, rinse, spin . . .
Ted, what are you doing here? You can't fly this plane!
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Elaine, I don't have time to say this gently so I'll be very direct everyone on this plane is in a desperate situation, Mr. Striker is the only hope we've got.
Those are the flaps, this is the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights   Mayday, mayday, mayday.
MAYDAY? What the hell does that mean?
Mayday? Why that's the Russian New Year. You know, we'll have a big parade, we'll serve hot hor'doevres . .
I can't stand it anymore, I've got to get outta here. I've gotta get outta here.
Calm down get ahold of yourself.
Stewardess, please, let me handle this
Calm down, now get back to your seat, I'll take care of this. CALM DOWN, GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF !
Mr, your wanted on the phone . . . Everything's going to be alright ! Please.
Sister, I'll handle this.
Excuse me, we'd like you to have this flower
Excuse me sir, would you . . .

Help Jerry's kids?

Avoid nuclear power?
Your attention please! No Frills passengers no arriving please have your baggage claim checks ready to show the attendant upon leaving the terminal.
I know but this guy has no flying experience at'all. He's a menace to himself and everything else in the air. . . yes, birds too.
Okay, okay, he's a terrible risk, but what other choice have we got? That's the whole story there Rex, everything we know.
Alright Steve, lets face a few facts. As you know I flew with this man during the war. He's going to have enough on his mind without worrying about those times when . . . when things weren't so good.
Right now, things aren't so good.
Let me tell you something Steve, Ted Striker was a top notch squadron leader a long time ago.
I want you to get on the horn and talk that guy down Now, you're going to have to let him get the feel of that airplane, and you'll have to talk him on to the approach. So help me, you'll have to talk him right down to the ground.
Very well, put Striker on the speaker.
Use my radio there. Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit drinking.
Now, you can work 'im direct from here, Captain.
Thanks. Striker . . . Striker, this is Captain Rex Kramer speaking.
YES, -CAPTAIN- Kramer, I read you loud and clear.
Alright, its obvious you remember me. What do you say you and I just forget about everything except what we have to do now.
Lets not kid each other _Kramer_ you know I've never flown a bucket like this. I'm gonna need all the luck there is.
Standby Striker. Our one hope is to build this man up, I've got to give him all the confidence I can. Striker- have you ever flown a multi-engine plane before?
NO, never.
SHIT! This is a God damned waste of time, there's no way he can land that plane.
Grab ahold of yourself, you gotta talk him down, you gotta.
We ought to route him in Lake Michigan, at least we'll avoid killing innocent people.
You're the only chance they've got.
Alright, Striker, you listen and listen close flying a plane is no different from riding a bicycle, just alot harder to put baseball cards in the spokes. Now, first I want you to get the feel of the plane. Later, we'll run down the landing procedure. Now, I want you to disengage the automatic pilot . . . watch that you don't make any violent control movements like you did in the fighter planes.
Alright, I'm going to unlock the automatic pilot.
Now just remember the controls will feel very heavy compared to a fighter. Don't worry about that its perfectly normal.   Now one more thing, is there somebody there who can work the radio and leave you free for flying?
Yes, the stewardess is here with me.
Good, have her sit in the co-pilot's seat.
Elaine, he wants you to sit in the co-pilot's seat.
What's going on? We have a right to know the truth!
Alright, I'm going to level with you all. The most important thing now is that you remain calm. There's no reason to panic . Now, it is true that one of the crew members is ill, slightly ill, but the other two pilots are just fine, they're at the controls, flying the plane, free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
The radio's all yours now. And keep an eye on that number 3 engine gauge over there, its running a little hot
Striker, before we start, I'd like to say something. I know that right now things must look pretty rough up there, but if you do what I tell you, when I tell you to do it, there's no reason why you shouldn't have complete confidence in your chances to come out of this thing alive and in one piece. Striker, what kind of weather are you in up there?
Rain!
And a little ice.
And a little ice.
How's it handling?
Sluggish, like a wet sponge.
Sluggish, like a wet sponge.
Alright, Striker, your doing just fine.
Its a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Its a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Mnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Can I get you something?
S'mo fo butter layin' to the bone. Jackin' me up. Tightly.
I'm sorry I don't understand.
Cutty say he cant hang.
Oh stewardess, I speak jive.
Ohhhh, good.
He said that he's in great pain and he wants to know if you can help him.
Would you tell him to just relax and I'll be back as soon as I can with some medicine.
Jus' hang loose blooood. She goonna catch up on the` rebound a de medcide.
What it is big mamma, my mamma didn't raise no dummy, I dug her rap.
Cut me som' slac' jak! Chump don wan no help, chump don git no help. Jive ass dude don got no brains anyhow.
Get me Captain Oever's wife on the phone, we'd better let her know what's going on.
Chief, this weather bulletin just came off the wire.
Johnny, what can you make outta this?
This? Why I could make a hat, or a brooch, a pterodactyl. . .
Hello?
Mrs. Oever?
Yes, this is Mrs. Oever.
This is Ed Masias calling from the airport. There's some trouble on your husband's flight. We don't know how serious it is yet, but Steve McCrosky say you may want to get down here right away.
Yes, I'll be right down. . . I've gotta go to the airport, you can let yourself out the back door. There's juice in the refridger- ator.
Nayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.... plllllllllllllllllllll. Winey.
Dr Rumack says the sick people are getting worse and we`re running out of time.
I've got to concentrate oncentrate, oncentrate. I've got to concentrate, concentrate, concentrate. Hello, hello, hello. Echo, echo, echo. Pinch hitting for Pedro Borbau Manny Motta, motta, motta.
How're you doing honey?
I'm so hot, I'm burning up.
I'll turn on some air.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic, when do we start down?
Not just yet, but you're in our range any second now. I don't understand it should have been in range 10 minutes ago. Genderson, check the radar range, anything yet?
Its about 2 more minutes chief.
2 more minutes? They could be miles off course.
That's impossible there on instruments
This is going to be a real sweat. Genderson, let me know when you get anything. Got a cigarette Nelson? I can't take much more of this. Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines. Johnny, how about some more coffee?
NO THANKS!
Chief, these reporters won't leave without a statement.
How much longer can those passengers hold out?
A, half an hour or less.
Who's flying the plane?
One of the passengers. But, he's an experienced Air Force pilot who flew during the war, so there's no cause for alarm. . . Here, take over.
What kind of plane is it?
Oh its a big pretty white plane with red stripes, curtains in the window and wheels. It looks like a big tylenol.
Okay boys, lets get some pictures.
This bulletin just handed to me . . . stricken airliner approaches Chicago.
They bought their tickets, they knew what they were getting into. I say let em crash.
Would you like a little whiskey ma'am?
CERTAINLY NOT!
How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you Mr. Striker . . . we're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
I'm doing everything I can and stop calling me Shirley.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T find out what it means to me . . . Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me . . . A little respect Just a little bit . . .
Booo-hooo
Randy, are you alright?
Oh, Dr. Rumack, I'm scared. I've never been so scared. And besides, I'm 26 and I'm not married.
We're going to make it, you've got to believe that.
Dr. Rumack, do you have any idea when we'll be landing?
Pretty soon, how are you bearing up?
Well, to be honest, I've never been so scared. But, at least I have a husband.
Stay in formation, target's just ahead. Target should be clear if you go in low enough. You'll have to decide You'll have to decide...
oh rats! we lost number 4.
What happened Ted, what went wrong?
The oil pressure, I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan
Watch that oil temperature, what the hell's he doing up there? Striker, that plane can't land itself, it takes a pilot that can handle pressure.
Ease off Rex, he hasn't flown for years, its not his fault. It could happen to any pilot.
It happened to Barbara Stanwick.
Don't push him too hard, give him a break. You gotta remember who you're dealing with.
Nick, Leaf, Jerrod, there's a fire in the barn.
He's right, I can't take the pressure. I was crazy to think I could land this plane.
Ted, you're the only hope.
I don't care. I don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Bad news, the fog is getting thicker.
And Leon's getting laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrger.
I know what you're going to say, so save your breath.
Well, I don't have anything to say, you've done the best you could. You really have, the best you could. You can't expect to win em all. But, I want to tell you something I've kept to myself through these years. I was in the war myself, medical corps. I was on late duty one night when they brought in a badly wounded pilot from one of the raids. He could barely talk. He looked at me and said " The odds were against us up there, but we went in anyway, I'm glad Captain made the right decision. The pilot's name was George Zip.
George Zip said that?
The last thing he said to me, doc, he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it, the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to get out there and give it all they got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then doc, he said, but I won't smell too good, that's for sure.
Excuse me doc, I got a plane to land.
Alright Striker, you'd better stay up there for a bit, as soon as the fog lifts, we'll bring you in.
I'll take it Elaine. Listen to me Kramer, Dr. Rumack says the sick people are in critical condition. And every minute counts. We've got to land now.
Don't be a fool Striker, you know what a landing like this means, you more than anybody. I'm ordering you to stay up there.
NO DICE CHICAGO. I'm giving the orders and we're coming in. I guess the foot's on the other hand now, isn't it Kramer?
He'll never make it in this soup, not one chance in a million.
I know, I know, but its his ship now, his command, he's in charge, he's the boss, head man, top dog, big cheese,
Captain, look at this!
Passengers certain to die!
Airline negligent.
There's a sale at Penny's!
Alright, I'll need 3 men up in the tower. You Newbower, you Maceias. . .
Me John! Big tree.
Standby, Striker. We're going to the tower, good luck.
The tower, the tower . . . Repunzle, Repunzle . . .
Stewardess, how soon so we land?
It won't be long now, try not to worry.
We're all ready sir, this is Captain McCrosky, Captain Roberts, Captain Kramer, Captain Kolosomo, Captain Henshaw this is Captain Gatz, Captain Kramer, Captain Gatz, Captain Henshaw, Captain Roberts.
Alright Kolosomo, you work the relay, Roberts, check all air traffic within five miles, get that finger out of your ear, you don't know where that finger's been   Got a cigarette Nels? Your husband and the others are alive, but unconscious.
Just like Gerald Ford.
Now, there's a chance we can save them, if Striker can get that plane down in time.
That isn't much of a chance, is it?
I don't know, I don't know, but we're doing everything we can, now excuse me huh?
Where did you get that dress? Its aweful . . . and those shoes, and that coat, geeeeeeeeeeeeeezzzzzzzz.
8 miles. Looks like their heading 0-4-4.
We are now at 2000 feet beginning our decent.
Steve, I want every light you can get poured onto that field.
Tower to all emergency vehicles, runway is 9er. Airport vehicles take stations 1 and 2. Civilian equipment number 3. Air Force positions number 4 and 5. All ambulances go to number 3. Air Israel, please clear the runway
In a moment, we'll ask you to assume crash positions. your life jackets are located under your seat. Place the jacket over your head. And when I give the word, pull the cord on the right side flap. Your seat cushions are also equipped with a flotation device.
WZAZ in Chicago, where disco lives forever
Watch your altitude Striker, you're too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours of flying.
I'll take it Elaine. Listen to me Kramer! We have people up here who will die in less than an hour let alone two. I may bend your precious airplane, but I'll get it down. I'm putting the landing gear down now.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Thank you Randy. You'd better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt up here.
Ted,
Yes?
I wanted you to know, now . . . I'm very proud.
Tell 'em the gear is down and we're ready to land.
The gear is down and we're ready to land.
Alright, he's on final now, put out all runway lights except 9er.
Captain, maybe we ought to turn on the search lights now.
No, thats just what they'll be expecting us to do.
I just want to tell you both good luck, we're all counting on you.
Alright, now just listen carefully . . . you should be able to see the runway at 300 feet. Aim the touchdown a third of the way along. There's a slight crosswind from the right so be ready for it. Land too fast, use your emergency breaks. The red handle's right in front of you. If that doesn't stop you . . . . . . if that doesn't stop you cut the four ignition switches over the co-pilot's head. Do you see us now? You should be able to see the field now.
It sure is quiet out there. . .
Yeah, too quiet.
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.
There it is.
There he is. Striker, you're coming in too fast . . .
I know, I know.
He knows, he knows.
Getting below 700 now, still going down. 675, 650, 625, he's holding. . .no, no he's down, he's down.
Sound your alarm bell, now.
Alright now everybody, get in crash positions
Put down 30 degrees of flap. Striker now listen to me Remember your breaks and switches, get ready to fly it out . . .
He's all over the place, 900 feet, up to 1300 feet . . . what an asshole.
More mast rudder, put down more flap . . .
Just kidding.
Striker, lift your nose, straighten your wings. You're coming in too fast, watch your speed.
He's coming right at us . . .
You're coming in too hot. Ease up on the throttle. Watch for that crosswind. Aim for the numbers, you'll have to dip your left wing. You're drifting, keep your eyes on the far end of the runway. You're too low damnit! Watch your stall speed. Ease her down, down. The break . . . pull the red handle.
I just want to tell you both good luck, we're all counting on you.
Flight 2-0-9 now arriving gate 8- gate 9, gate 10
Push a button.
Gate 13, gate 14, gate 15 . . .
Auntie Em, Uncle Henry, toto . . . its a twister, its a twister.
Gate 23, 24, 25 . . .
I just want to tell you both-- good luck, we're all counting on you.
Striker, Striker, you alright?
Yeah, we're okay.
Ted that was probably the worst landing in the history of this airport, but some of us here, particularly me would like to buy you a drink and shake your hand . . and Ted I just want you to know that when the going got rough . . .
Okay alright, have a nice day . . .have a nice day, thank you for flying TransAmerican.
Lonliness, thats the bottom line. I was never happy as a child . . . Christmas Ted, what does that mean to you? It was living hell. Do you know what its like falling in the mud and getting kicked, in the head. With an iron boot? Of course you don't, no one does, that never happens. Sorry Ted, that's a dumb question.
Have a nice day.
Municipal bonds Ted, I'm talking double A rating. . . the best investment in America.
